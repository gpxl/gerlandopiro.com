I took a small step today. A few days ago I signed up for [Gumroad&#39;s Small Product Lab](https://gumroad.com/smallproductlab), a challenge in which participants launch a product in the span of 10 days.  Today was the first day of the challenge and the goal was to figure out &quot;What&#39;s your product?&quot; and to announce it to the Product Lab&rsquo;s community. This was easy for me in one sense in that I already knew what I wanted to do (screenprint shirts). It was also extremely difficult in that most of the community seemed to be focused on digital info-products and ebooks tailored to helping other people reach their goals, while my product is physical as well as being my first creative endeavor in over 15 years.

Thankfully, the response from the community was overwhelmingly positive. A few people mentioned they would have liked to make a physical product but didn&#39;t think they could make it happen in the short, 10 day, timeframe. What a revelation! I had been struggling with the thought that a physical product wasn&rsquo;t interesting or cool enough or not businessy enough. Now I feel a little better about the path I&rsquo;m taking, a little bit more confident in what I&rsquo;m doing, and a huge relief that I wasn&rsquo;t burned at the stake for my idea (irrational thought I know, but self-doubt is funny that way).

So a few takeaways from the day 1. Gumroad has a good thing going with the [Small Product Lab](https://gumroad.com/smallproductlab), it&rsquo;s a well crafted piece of content marketing and community building. Second, it&rsquo;s better to put your ideas out into the world rather than hold them inside and let self doubt destroy them.
