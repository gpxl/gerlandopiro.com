This is the second journal entry detailing my efforts to build an [Email notifications for Stripe](/2015/09/18/stripe-notifications-preannouncement.html) application.

Today I spent a good amount of time working on a wireframe for the application's homepage. The goal of the homepage is to convey a need and provide a solution for that need. Crafting a well defined message is hard and in hindsight I should have worked on the content before attempting to lay it out. 

Here's where I ended up.

## Main Message
**Email Notifications for Stripe**
One click to get instant, actionable, insight from your Stripe Events

## Secondary Message
**Create better customers**
Know whatâ€™s happening and improve your response times for:

* New Customer Onboarding
* Trial Conversion Optimization  
* Charge Dispute Management
* Credit Card Dunning
* Customer Retention
