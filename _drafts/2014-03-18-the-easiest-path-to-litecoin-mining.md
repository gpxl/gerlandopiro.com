Before the release of Gridseed ASIC miners, effectively mining altcoins such as Litecoin and Dogecoin required building a computer dedicated for the purpose. They were loud, ran hot, and required a lot of power to run.
Driving computers hard in the effort to maximize returns also lead to instability and component failure. I personally have lost a few weekends nurturing a failed rig back to health and it is absolutely __no fun__.

Thankfully there is finally an alternative. With the recent release of the Gridseed ASIC mining device and Scrypta Linux distribution for Raspberry Pi, getting started with Indirect Bitcoin Mining has never been easier.
Let's take a look at the most basic scenario, controlling one Gridseed device with a Raspberry Pi.

Here's the hardware you will need with appropriate vendor links:

[Raspberry Pi - Model B Starter Kit](http://www.amazon.com/CanaKit-Raspberry-Complete-Original-Preloaded/dp/B008XVAVAW/?tag=shnomo-20) : This kit includes the Raspberry Pi computer as well as a power supply and SD card.
[Gridseed ASIC Miner](http://zoomhash.com/products/batch-9-320-kh-s-asic-scrypt-sha-miner-ships-from-los-angeles-ships-3-20-2014) : ZoomHash is my preferred vendor. They have great prices and ship in a timely manner. This includes a usb mini to usb cable but not a power supply.
[Gridseed Power Supply](http://www.amazon.com/Replacement-Monitor-Adapter-Power-Supply/dp/B0023Y9EQC/?tag=shnomo-20) : A simple, inexpensive power supply.
[Scrypta Linux Distribution for Gridseed](https://mega.co.nz/#!uZAGFI6S!xVhHZdNvGij2L6gJk_VXnaTewgr7gFjOjnOCTtO_HHU) : This distribution is set up for nearly plug and play use.

### Installing Scrypta



### Configuring Scrypta

### What next?

Now that we're up and running the natural progression is to take our system and scale it with more Gridseed units. This brings about some additional complexity that will be addressed in a future article.
