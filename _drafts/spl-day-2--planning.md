> A quick recap... I&#39;m participating in Gumroad&#39;s Small Product Lab, a challenge to develop and launch a product in 10 days. I&#39;m going to be launching a t-shirt brand! This post is part 2. You can [read part 1 here](/2015/07/28/one-small-step.html).

The challenge for day 2 of the Small Product Lab was to plan out the remaining 8 days. Many of my peers submitted plans with details for each day. Most of them used software such as Trello, Excel, and Basecamp and I was tempted to use one of those apps as well (I have plenty of experience with them from my web dev work). Instead I picked up my trusty Github notebook and Pentel mechanical pencil and jotted down the big items that would need to get knocked out in the course of the project. This overview is good enough for me to create daily todo lists as the project progresses, but I felt like I was cheating a bit, so I made an honest attempt to work out a daily plan from Day 10 till today. I only got 5 days in before I ran out of ideas, appropriately enough on a day titled &quot;Assessment&quot;. 

As for daily progress, I put some effort into getting my [Gumroad pre-launch page](https://gumroad.com/gpxl/follow) together. Take a look, and follow please! :) I haven&#39;t quite worked out my marketing pitch so just getting this page built sank me into a mini rabbit hole of naming the t-shirt brand. On one hand it would be nice to have a name, but on the other... why not just have a symbol &amp; leave it up to interpretation? BTW: If a name strikes you, I&#39;m all ears!

I also got my printer set up for printing films. Films are used in conjunction with an exposure light to burn artwork onto screens, which are then used to print onto shirts. That was pretty painless. I&#39;m using Accurip software with BlackMax inks in an Epson 1430 printer. It&#39;s not a cheap set up but quality screens lead to quality prints (or so I&#39;m told).

 

Things are going so smooth! The only thing left on my todo list for the day was to get my screens coated with emulsion so I could finally burn some artwork onto them tomorrow. With only a couple of hours left in the day, my son Donovon and I got our screens lined up, opened a new box of emulsion, read the instructions, and were immediately deflated. I mentioned planning wasn&#39;t my strong point right? Well the emulsion needed to be mixed with another ingredient to be activated, then stored for 2 hours before being used. So here I am writing this post, waiting until midnight for the emulsion to be ready for the screens. I suppose I&#39;ll try to plan the days going forward a bit better than I did today.
