> A quick recap&hellip; I&#39;m participating in Gumroad&#39;s Small Product Lab, a challenge to develop and launch a product in 10 days. I&#39;m going to be launching [a t-shirt brand](https://gumroad.com/gpxl/follow)! This post is part 5. You can catch up by reading entries [1](/2015/07/28/one-small-step.html), [2](/2015/07/29/spl-day-2--planning.html), [3](/2015/07/30/hitting-a-rough-patch.html), and [4](/2015/07/31/unexpected-perspective.html).

It now day 6 of the SPL and the goal for today is to take a break and assess where I&#39;m at. The timing is perfect as I need the break. I skipped day 5 (goal: create a preorder page) simply because I had a hard time focusing for any length of time yesterday. Today I&#39;m fatigued and have a pretty bad headache, both of which I attribute to a lack of sleep from working through midnight consistently since the SPL started. It&#39;s certainly not easy holding a day job, raising a family, and launching a product under a compressed timeframe. That&#39;s not to say it hasn&#39;t been a great experience, I just don&#39;t think I&#39;ll be keeping myself to this schedule with future projects!

While I didn&#39;t accomplish yesterday&#39;s goal, I was able to continue making progress with screenprinting. Although I&#39;m still making newbie errors, I finally got a screen burned and ready to print. I had to burn two screens as the first one was done with the image reversed, but the final screen looks pretty decent. Later today, if this headache goes away, the plan is to run a couple of test prints.
