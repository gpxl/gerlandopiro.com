    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Curious about Cryptocurrencies but not sure where to start? Here&#8217;s a quick cheat sheet of resources to get you started.</p>

<h3>The Cryptocurrency Market</h3>

<p><a href="https://www.coinbase.com/?r=5297831b5446868b09000036">Coinbase</a> is a Bitcoin exchange located in San Francisco. They are one of the most well funded Bitcoin companies in the world and provide a high <a href="https://coinbase.com/security">level of security</a> around their services.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.cryptsy.com/users/register?refid=105115">Cryptsy</a> is a cryptocurrency exchange serving a huge number of coins. Cryptsy provides a crucial link in facilitating the conversion of alt-coins into Bitcoin.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.coinwarz.com/cryptocurrency">Coinwarz</a> lists the profitability of various cryptocurrencies. The calculations are done in real-time and are prone to wild swings so it&#8217;s not the most reliable data, but it can serve as a good overview of the cryptocurrency market.</p>

<p><a href="http://bitcoinity.org/markets">Bitcoinity</a> provides simple Bitcoin value charts for various exchanges. This site displays the current Bitcoin value in your browser tab so it remains useful even when not in focus.</p>

<p><a href="http://bitinfocharts.com">Bitinfocharts</a> shows detailed information on the largest cryptocurrency markets. It&#8217;s amazing to see how much larger Bitcoin is relative to everything else. The parabolic difficulty curve is even more impressive ;)</p>

<h3>Cryptocurrency Mining</h3>

<p><a href="https://litecoin.info/Mining_hardware_comparison">GPU Mining Hardware Comparison</a>: This is a reference list of results with various GPU and CPU hardware along with the config settings. You&#8217;ll want a card with a high hash rate (kH/s) to power (W) ratio. The card with the best ratio available, the AMD 7950, is discontinued and close to impossible to find at a good price. The r9 280x and r9 290 are good alternatives that are much easier to find.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.cryptobadger.com/build-your-own-litecoin-mining-rig">Guide to Building Your Own Litecoin Mining Rig</a>: This guide was the template from which I built my rig. The specific set of parts he lists is nearly impossible to find, but this will give you an idea of what to look for.</p>

<p><a href="https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=28402.0">Mining Software: CGMiner 3.7.2</a>: This is the reference thread for CGMiner, the software that will run your miner.</p>

<p><a href="http://middlecoin2.s3-website-us-west-2.amazonaws.com">MiddleCoin Mining Pool</a>: This is my go to pool. Middlecoin is an auto-switching pool that seeks the most profitable alt coins to maximize the return on your hashing power. It also auto-exchanges mined coins and pays out in Bitcoin (BTC). Better still, joining the pool is as simple as pointing your miner at it using a Bitcoin wallet address.</p>

    <id>http://www.gerlandopiro.com/2014/02/09/calculating-cryptocurrency-mining-roi-and-profitability</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I have a simple way of calculating the time to ROI and profitability on my mining rigs. The formula is as follows.</p>

<ol>
<li><p><a href="http://bitcoinity.org/markets">Look up the current value of a Bitcoin</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>Visit a auto-switching mining pool, my current favorite is <a href="http://www.middlecoin.com">Middlecoin</a>, and get the current BTC/Mhs/day rate.</p></li>
<li><p>Calculate the cost to build a rig that achieves about 1 Mhs/day. A good starting point is 3 r9 270xs, 2 r9 280xs, or 2 r9 290s. A full list of cards and hash rates can be found <a href="https://litecoin.info/Mining_hardware_comparison">here</a>. Then, start pricing parts. <a href="http://www.newegg.com">NewEgg</a> is a good place to start. You&#8217;ll need a motherboard, cpu, ram, power supply, usb drive, and one or more video cards.</p></li>
<li><p>Now simply calculate ($Bitcoin_Value<em>$Bitcoin_per_Mhs) to get your estimated daily payout and $Rig_cost/($Bitcoin_value</em>$Bitcoin_per_Mhs) to get your days till break even on your rig cost.</p></li>
</ol>


<p>This is a simple estimation which does not take into account volatility in Bitcoin value or an increase in mining difficulty, but I believe adding a projection of either is adding speculation upon speculation. The crypto currency market is not for the faint of heart, but at least this should give you a baseline expectation with which to plan and track your progress.</p>

    <link href="http://www.gerlandopiro.com/2014/02/02/crypto-currency-mining-update-january-2014/"/>

    <id>http://www.gerlandopiro.com/2014/02/02/crypto-currency-mining-update-january-2014</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>It&#8217;s been a bit over a month since I started an experiment in mining Cryptocurrencies. One of the big questions I had going into it was wether or not mining could actually be profitable. In the time that I have been mining, daily payouts have been about 0.012 BTC/Mhs/day. That works out to about $10/day. In my <a href="http://www.gerlandopiro.com/2014/01/02/a-small-mining-adventure-the-beginning">previous post</a> I mentioned a 1.2Mh/s rig cost $1260 to put together so, at the current average rate, my projection of a 4 month payback schedule was accurate.</p>

<p>Below is a chart of daily earnings since the beginning of the experiment.</p>

<p><img src="http://www.gerlandopiro.com/images/january-update.png" alt="January Mining Chart" /></p>

<p>You&#8217;ll notice a pretty good rate of growth. That&#8217;s because I not only finished the build of my first rig, I decided to add a second rig and effectively double my hash rate. There was an additional spike in the last few days due to growth in Dogecoin which increased payouts to 0.017 BTC/Mh/day. I don&#8217;t expect this to last long term, but it&#8217;s interesting because it&#8217;s a common assumption that profitability should fall over time due to increased difficulty. At least over the short term, this is clearly not correct.</p>

    <link href="http://www.gerlandopiro.com/2014/01/02/a-small-mining-adventure-the-beginning/"/>
    <updated>2014-01-02T21:30:00-08:00</updated>
    <id>http://www.gerlandopiro.com/2014/01/02/a-small-mining-adventure-the-beginning</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;ve been intrigued by the buzz surrounding Bitcoin since it spiked in value in early 2013 due to the near collapse of the Cyprus economy. A subsequent larger spike caused by increased interest in China finally caused me to go forward with building out a Litecoin mining rig and trying my luck as a small time miner.</p>

<p>The decision to mine Litecoin rather than Bitcoin was based simply out of accessibility. Bitcoin mining is extremely competitive and expensive nowadays. It also relies on specialized hardware often times from unreliable sources. Litecoin can still be mined effectively on standard computing hardware and exchanges such as <a href="https://www.cryptsy.com">Cryptsy</a> allow one to exchange Litecoin for Bitcoin.</p>

<p>I set out my plan with two main goals. Satisfying my curiosity around mining and breaking even financially.</p>

<p>With the help of <a href="http://www.coinminingrigs.com">CoinMiningRigs.com</a>, <a href="http://www.cryptobadger.com/build-your-own-litecoin-mining-rig">CryptoBadger</a>, and the advice of a coworker I pieced together the following components to build a computer for the first time since high school.</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s what I ordered.</p>

<ul>
<li>GPUS - (2) MSI R7950 Twin Frozr</li>
<li>Power Supply - Cooler Master Silent Pro Gold - 1200W</li>
<li>RAM - G.SKILL Ripjaws X Series 4GB 240-Pin DDR3 SDRAM</li>
<li>Motherboard - ASRock 990FX Extreme3 AM3+</li>
<li>CPU - AMD Sempron 145 Sargas 2.8GHz Socket AM3 45W Single-Core Desktop Processor</li>
<li>Hard Drive - SanDisk ReadyCache 32 GB SSD</li>
<li>&#8220;Case&#8221; - White Plastic Storage Crate</li>
</ul>


<p>Scoping out components is an interesting challenge starting with simply finding a place that had the parts required! I just happened on a couple of 7950 GPUs which are highly regarded for their hash rate/power ratio. I should be able to get 1200kH/s at 600W.</p>

<p>The motherboard and power supply were both chosen with expansion in mind. Once the rig is up and running I should be able to add two more GPUs for a total of 2400kH/s.</p>

<p>The CPU, memory, storage, and case were all chosen to be inexpensive as they have little affect on hash rate.</p>

<p>The total cost for this build was $1260 and, at the time of purchase was expected to break even in about 4 months. I can lower the break even point to 3 months, and double my hash rate, if I invest another $800 to add 2 GPUs to the rig. Apparently you really do need to spend money to earn money.</p>

<p>Getting the rig up and running was a lot more difficult than I expected. Through a few frustrating days of trial and error I figured out one of the GPUs I received was bad and needed to be set for repair. This unexpected set back would cut my hash rate in half and push my time to break even out to nine months!</p>

<p>So I did what any rational gambler would do and I bought a 3rd GPU so I&#8217;d have at least two running full time while the third was sent away for repairs.</p>

<p>Thankfully the additional GPU plugged in and powered up without incident and I&#8217;ve been happily mining for about a week an a half. Simply getting the rig sourced, built, and running took longer than expected but once I started mining I discovered Litecoin wasn&#8217;t the most profitable coin to mine. Lesson one was complete, but the education was just starting.</p>

    <id>http://www.gerlandopiro.com/2013/09/25/quick-thoughts-on-the-iphone-5c</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I finally got some time with the iPhone 5c at the Apple Store the other day and you know what? It&#8217;s an iPhone 5 in a plastic case. It&#8217;s a solid case no doubt, but it&#8217;s lacks the high quality feel of the aluminum or glass bodied iPhones. On the upside, the colors Apple selected for the 5c are vibrant and striking enough to make the new 5s look a bit uptight. It&#8217;s easy to envision the 5c capturing a large share of those simply interested having a stylish phone, and that&#8217;s the point.</p>

<p>The iPhone5c is plenty powerful for a majority of people, it keeps people interested in last year&#8217;s technology, and the cheaper build quality allows larger margins on each one sold. If 5c margins are better than those of the 5s, the introduction of the 5c could the most shrewd moves Apple has made in years. It allows them to increase sales and margins in a large segment of the market, while the 5s keeps their story of innovation in the premium segment of the market intact. Not bad for a bit of metal reinforced polycarbonate.</p>

    <link href="http://www.gerlandopiro.com/2013/09/16/refactoring-css-with-sass/"/>
    <updated>2013-09-16T14:10:00-07:00</updated>
    <id>http://www.gerlandopiro.com/2013/09/16/refactoring-css-with-sass</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>&#8220;Sass is an extension of CSS that adds power and elegance to the basic language. It allows you to use variables, nested rules, mixins, inline imports, and more, all with a fully CSS-compatible syntax. Sass helps keep large stylesheets well-organized, and get small stylesheets up and running quickly, particularly with the help of the Compass style library.&#8221;</p>

<p>That text taken from the Sass reference page sums up what makes Sass awesome, it allows you to be more efficient with your CSS and removes a lot of the frustration that comes with the sprawling highly duplicated stylesheets that come with any reasonably sized project.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve been using Sass in my Rails apps for a few years now but I have yet to apply everything Sass has to offer in my own work. That has always been something that bugged me and so I&#8217;m finally going to do something about it.</p>

<p>With a couple of guide books in hand, The <a href="http://pragprog.com/book/pg_sass/pragmatic-guide-to-sass">Pragmatic Guide to Sass</a> by Hampton and Michael Lintorn Catlin and <a href="http://smacss.com">Scalable and Modular Architecture for CSS</a> by Jonathan Snook, I&#8217;m going to dig into Sass to see what techniques are most beneficial in refactoring and maintaining a medium sized site, Engineyard.com.</p>

<p>The current <a href="https://www.engineyard.com/assets/application.css">site CSS</a> weighs in at a hefty 162kb <strong>after</strong> being compiled by the Rails Asset Pipeline and contains <a href="http://colorpalettes.gerlandopiro.com/colormaps/engineyard"><strong>197 unique colors</strong> in <strong>1488 css tags</strong></a>. Clearly there&#8217;s a lot of work to be done, but it&#8217;s going to be a lot of fun as well.</p>

    <title type="html"><![CDATA[Introducing Color Palettes]]></title>
    <link href="http://www.gerlandopiro.com/2013/09/01/introducing-colorpalettes/"/>
    <updated>2013-09-01T11:32:00-07:00</updated>
    <id>http://www.gerlandopiro.com/2013/09/01/introducing-colorpalettes</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This month I created a little web app, <a href="http://colorpalettes.gerlandopiro.com">Color Palettes</a> to visualize the colors used on popular websites. The inspiration came from a discussion with <a href="http://www.twitter.com/jina">@jina</a> in which we discussed how to show people the benefits of using SASS over plain HTML.
Of course, one of the easy wins with using something like SASS is reduced duplication of code. So I thought, what if there was a tool that quickly showed how much duplication there was in their existing stylesheets. Color Palettes is the first result of that thought and a bit of weekend hackery.
The site reads in a website&#8217;s stylesheets and presents the colors grouped by number of instances found. It&#8217;s extremely limited at the moment but it&#8217;s still fun to throw a url at it and see what comes back. Here&#8217;s what I&#8217;ve found from the sites indexed so far.</p>

<h3>Complexity is everywhere</h3>

<p>Every stylesheet so far has shown multiple variations of the same color within a color palette. For example, it&#8217;s extremely common to see white represented by the values &#8216;white&#8217;, #fff, and #ffffff.</p>

<h3>50 shades of grey</h3>

<p>Monochrome values rule everyone&#8217;s color palettes. Transparent and white are almost universally the most used values in stylesheets which is interesting since one would think such basic colors would be defined at a high level within the CSS and overwritten as needed, not defined over and over again throughout a stylesheet.</p>

<h3>Apple has the least amount of colors and complexity</h3>

<p>For a company renowned for it&#8217;s design, <a href="http://colorpalettes.gerlandopiro.com/colormaps/apple">Apple</a> sure keeps it simple on the css front with only 39 colors in 147 tags. One thing in their favor, from a colors standpoint, is that they rely on imagery a lot more than most companies.</p>

<h3>Is this interesting?</h3>

<p>If you discover any other interesting insights from <a href="http://colorpalettes.gerlandopiro.com">Color Palettes</a> I&#8217;d love to hear about them! You can also find the <a href="https://github.com/gpxl/DryCss">css parsing gem</a> and <a href="https://github.com/gpxl/colorpalettes">website</a> code on Github if you feel like it.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>MisfitCon(f) 2014</p>

<p>For all my recent efforts to become a more consistent writer (1000 words a day right?), I never took the time to write about one of the biggest events of my 2013, Misfit Conf in Fargo, North Dakota. Maybe it was due to the long period of reflection and introspection the event triggered, but by the time I had things sorted out there were already a lot of words written by far more eloquent folks than myself. Those stories, whether through words or imagery, told the story with such vibrancy I felt I had nothing more to add. So I&#8217;m going to write about next year. :)</p>

<p><a href="http://aj-leon.com/misfit-con-2014">MisfitCon 2014</a> was recently announced and along with it a return to Fargo, ND. An interesting thing happened when I read that, everything fell into place and it was clear that it could be nowhere else. MisfitCon was born in Fargo and while it was an amazing experience, it was just a spark. A brilliant spark no doubt, but there&#8217;s something fascinating about revisiting something and doing it in a completely different way. It will be amazing to see how people have changed and grown in the year since. I&#8217;m excited to meet new faces as the attendee list shifts and grows. And it will be interesting to visit Fargo from a different perspective.</p>

<p>The first go around Fargo was a complete unknown but what I quickly found was that it was full of friendly creative people with a pride of community that I had never felt before. Fargo may be small, but it&#8217;s far from being the middle of nowhere. An oasis perhaps?</p>

<p>AJ has stated 2014 will be a re-imagining the entire weekend from scratch and I have no doubt that it will be at once familiar and profoundly perspective shifting.</p>

<p>To the Misfit alums, I can&#8217;t wait to see you again in May.</p>

    <link href="http://www.gerlandopiro.com/2013/07/12/changing-perspective/"/>
    <updated>2013-07-12T08:10:00-07:00</updated>
    <id>http://www.gerlandopiro.com/2013/07/12/changing-perspective</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I learned at an early age that it&#8217;s better to be alone than to be surrounded by people who would do harm. Even so, sometimes life leaves you no choice and conflict is unavoidable. When these situations arise, it&#8217;s easy to get mired in negativity, anger, doubt, anxiety or even depression. But with a change in perspective and a lot of perseverance, you can bend the universe to your will and end up a stronger person for it.</p>

<p>A few years ago I was recruited by a mentor of mine to work at a startup with him. He had built a wonderful team who all worked extremely well together and I looked forward to each workday. Unfortunately that all that changed within a few months with the hiring of a new head of marketing.</p>

<p>David was an extremely arrogant individual who used a mask of hubris to hide the true insecure self lying underneath. This insecurity led to him systematically firing everyone on the team, from the top down, replacing them with people he thought he could control. As the most junior member, watched for a full year as each team member started receiving poor performance reviews followed by increased workload demands leading to an eventual layoff. The entire year was miserable but I kept at it because I <em>needed</em> this job. How would I support my family otherwise? Mental images of my family on the street stressed me to the point of uncontrollable shaking. Finally with everyone else fired, it was my turn.</p>

<p>It started predictably with a poor performance review, the first one I had ever received in my eleven year career. My manager became increasingly abusive, once calling me at four in the morning screaming that my performance was unacceptable. Next came the demand that I travel from Seattle to SF on a weekly basis until I had proved myself. The threat of constant travel and not being able to spend time with my kids was the tipping point. My view shifted from trying to hold on, to trying to escape.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s a surprising thing when you view something from a different perspective, the universe tends to align to your new view. I started talking about my situation with others and I found an abundance of people willing to help me through my struggle with personal as well as professional and legal advice. The end result was I was able to start a short term contract as I was being laid off so I actually had a negative gap in unemployment. I also received a full two months severance so for a short time my income was the highest it had ever been, <em>as I was getting laid off!</em></p>

<p>More opportunity arrived a couple months later when I was recruited by another mentor for a new start up. I went from miserable for a year to surrounded with abundance because I chose not to be kept down anymore.</p>

<p>What happened to that paranoid, insecure head of marketing? He was replaced by one of his own hires a year later.</p>

<p>If you find yourself surrounded by negative, selfish people don&#8217;t let them keep you in their grasp. Keep a positive mindset and share your story. It&#8217;s a simple act that will uncover new avenues of support and abundance. Change your perspective, bend the universe, and watch the stars align.</p>

    <link href="http://www.gerlandopiro.com/2013/07/01/the-turning-point/"/>
    <updated>2013-07-01T06:47:00-07:00</updated>
    <id>http://www.gerlandopiro.com/2013/07/01/the-turning-point</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>As far as I remember, home life was unstable. My ideas of how people treat each other were guided by my parents who fought constantly, their fights with my older brother, and long stretches of TV. I was depressed, insecure and had a horrible outlook on the world around me. Until someone came along and sparked a light setting me on a path that lead me to where I am today, married with two wonderful kids and a solid group of friends.</p>

<p>But let’s start at the beginning. The earliest memories I have from childhood are of my dad and mom fighting to the point of violence. I cannot recall specifically living with both parents at the same time, but I know it must have happened as I can remember walking in on a fight that had gotten physical. I also recall being heartbroken seeing my dad tear to shreds a yellow baby chick stuffed animal he had bought my mom. The broken pieces an apt metaphor for their relationship and became even more apt when he stitched it back together upon seeing how upset I became. I treasured that little frankenstein chick. My parents would also fight with my brother who was forced out of our home at age sixteen. Screaming, doors slamming, and crying were the norm in my household.</p>

<p>School wasn’t much better. Teachers would single me out as a bad kid and made sure I was kept under close scrutiny. I once got punched by a girl in my class only to have my teacher tell me I must have done something to deserve it. I also was told I was always getting in trouble because my voice carried more than the other kids. I kid you not, my teachers were annoyed by my simple presence.</p>

<p>Once my parents got divorced I lived with my dad who would “encourage” me to go outside and play whenever he was home. I spent a lot of my time walking along the train tracks behind our apartment, catching lizards and flattening things on the tracks as trains flew by. I also enjoyed exploring the storm drain systems as you never knew where you would end up on the other side. By the time I had reached middle school I knew a whole system of shortcuts through my hometown. I could get all the way across town and never see another soul. It was nice being outside, much better than being home.</p>

<p>Home was always a dark place. When my parents were married there was constant fighting but after they divorced things got worse. Suddenly I was a latch key kid. My dad worked as much overtime as he could so during weekdays he would be sleeping when I left for school and wouldn’t return until 10 at night or later. My days were lonely as the TV and my cats were my only company. I actually once saw a neighbors baby choke to death from my balcony while firefighters tried to resuscitate it. I also experienced the 1989 Loma Preita quake alone in my living room. But most days I would simply make myself dinner, normally Ramen or a Hungry-Man and dread my dads arrival. Frustrated with his own place in life, my dad would come home and start yelling daily affirmations such as “You’re lazy”, “You’re never be anything”, “This is my house, if you don’t like it you can get the fuck out”. The funny thing is, I would have preferred to run away. If only I knew how.</p>

<p>Instead, my reaction was to make sure I was always in bed when he got home, feigning being asleep so he wouldn’t yell at me. Sometimes it would work, and sometimes the dishes left in the sink were just too much for him so he would wake me up and make sure I knew how worthless I was.</p>

<p>And true to his words, I became something worthless; an empty shell. Life held no joy for me and by the time I got to high school I had no friends, horrible grades, and no interests other than wasting away in front of a television; Just like my dad would do every chance he got. I tried fitting in and hanging out with various cliques but I always felt like I was on the outside looking in.</p>

<p>Thankfully there was someone that, for reasons unknown, actively tried to befriend me. I didn’t know it at the time, but that friendship was a turning point in my life.</p>

<p>Like me, he didn’t seem to fit into any of the high school cliques so we’d hangout a lot. Lunch would often be spent in the ice cream man’s truck. The ice cream man was a former high school attendee who found a way to extend his high school years by parking his ice cream truck across the street from the school to serve kids ice cream and creep on the teenage girls.</p>

<p>My newfound friend was always going on about going out to these underground parties called raves where people would break in to empty warehouses and play the worst music I had ever heard in my life. I had absolutely no interest in parties but eventually I relented since, let’s be honest, I had nothing else to do.</p>

<p>This was the early 90s and the scene was still in its early underground phase. Most parties were un-permitted and the first six events we went to were broken up by police before we arrived.</p>

<p>As two carless teenagers, this was heartbreaking. It was difficult to simply get a ride in those days and spending a night chasing down a goal that never materialized just sucked. I started to become affectionately known as the rave jinx. Somehow I was spreading whatever bad mojo I carried to those around me.</p>

<p>Then without notice, the stars aligned. A Rave Called Sharon was throwing a party in Half Moon Bay. My buddy persuaded a friend to make the hour long drive to the event to drop us off. We would be responsible for figuring out a way home in the morning, at the butt crack of dawn, in the middle of nowhere. So being the dumb feral kids we were, we said yes.</p>

<p>We had no idea what to expect when we got there. After an hour on the freeway we pulled off on a long dirt road. The area was pitch black and silent as we cruised down the road for what seemed like an eternity. Finally the path widened into a big valley and there it was. An electronic oasis tucked in the California hills with lasers fanning out overhead, a huge sound system, and thousands and thousands of people doing god knows what.</p>

<p>I don’t recall much of what happened that night except that something inside me woke up. Surrounded by an explosion of sound, light, and creative individuals; I found a bit of self confidence I had been lacking my entire life and I had found a group of people I could connect with.</p>

<p>I spent the next four years deeply immersing myself in the scene creating artwork for flyers, creating and running rave visuals, DJing, and helping friends throw events. Along the way I made thousands of friends, hundreds of which to this day form my core tribe, and it was at one of these events that I saw a girl that I instantly fell in love with. She was small, blonde, and had the same unhappy look I saw reflected in the mirror everyday of my life. I wanted to talk to her so badly, but instead I got trashed an passed out in a back room. My one other memory of the night was a brief moment of consciousness &amp; seeing her looking down at me. First impressions have never been my strong point.</p>

<p>A few months later we ran into each other at another event. We talked for the first time and spent most of the evening together. My head was spinning in what I felt an out of body experience. Was it through my own sheer will and desire that she liked me? Not exactly. It took a couple of years of distance to bring us together again, but we’ve now been married almost thirteen years, creating two beautiful children along the way. Now I get to be the the father I never had and give them the childhood I always wished for.</p>

<p>Life’s an interesting set of twists and turns. You start off naked and crying, and sometimes you stay that way for a while. Sometimes a stranger becomes a friend and helps you in ways that are unimaginable. And with a bit of luck, you get a chance to fix the past.</p>

    <link href="http://www.gerlandopiro.com/2013/06/27/untethered-removing-work-email/"/>
    <updated>2013-06-27T07:08:00-07:00</updated>
    <id>http://www.gerlandopiro.com/2013/06/27/untethered-removing-work-email</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I recently wiped my cell phone and installed the operating system from scratch rather than restore from backup. When it came time to set up email, I added my personal email address to the mail app but not my work email. Having been tethered to a work address for as long as I could remember, I was curious see what the consequences were. My mind&#8217;s reaction was immediate.</p>

<p>Frequent message checking was a habit I had developed to counter worries of &#8220;Something might be broken&#8221; or &#8220;I&#8217;m missing an important message from my boss&#8221;. With this tether broken I experienced an immediate swell of anxiety, fear, and uncertainty. Something was going to blow up or go wrong! It&#8217;s crazy I know, but irrational thoughts rarely come true and nothing caught on fire from my lack of email. Instead, lot of positives have come to light.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve realized that my personal email load is quite manageable, that is to say I&#8217;m not all that popular. I&#8217;ve been able to stay at &#8220;inbox zero&#8221; consistently which has a strange &#8220;spring cleaning&#8221; effect on the brain. Seriously, if you can&#8217;t remember having an empty inbox go archive everything right now&#8230; I&#8217;ll wait.</p>

<p>Back yet? Ok! With personal email managed and lack of fires at work, there&#8217;s no longer the urge to frequently check for new messages. Without the urge to check my phone, I&#8217;ve been able to focus on other aspects in life like spending quality time with my kids or improving my writing by creating more posts like these. My focus at work has improved as well since there is a better delineation of work and personal time. High fives all around!</p>

<p>It&#8217;s easy to feel that you need to always maintain oversight on your work. It makes you feel productive and in control. But it could be a shackle preventing you from a more balanced life. Try removing work email from your phone and see what happens.</p>

    <updated>2013-06-18T23:46:00-07:00</updated>
    <id>http://www.gerlandopiro.com/2013/06/18/planting-a-stake-in-the-ground</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>One of my goals for 2013 was to get better at writing by blogging more. I have many reasons for wanting this, but the biggest one is to overcome my introverted tendencies and see what resonates when I put my voice out into the world. However, by my own measure, I&#8217;ve been doing a horrible job so far with only nine posts published.</p>

<p>At first the issue was coming up with topics to write. I started this site with a challenge to create a web app that generated $5 in revenue and this skewed my thoughts as to what would be appropriate to post. Think about that, I mentally limited myself from day one based on expectations of a non-existant audience!</p>

<p>I recently attended <a href="http://aj-leon.com/misfit-conf">MisfitConf</a>, a conference of creative entrepreneurs that included an eclectic crowd of artists, life coaches, podcasters, writers, marketers, and so on. One of the messages I took away from the conference was to write about what you care about to find your voice. Since deciding that was the correct path for me, I&#8217;ve freed myself from self imposed limitations on topics and there has been no shortage of ideas for posts.</p>

<p>And yet I still struggle to write.</p>

<p>Another mental hangup I&#8217;ve discovered is the thought that a post has to meet a minimum word count to be of value. I&#8217;m not sure where this one came from, and I wasn&#8217;t clearly aware of it until today! The mind works in mysterious ways for sure. But again with the realization that I was needlessly holding myself back, I&#8217;m leaving that limitation behind. Posts will be as long as they need to be and no more.</p>

<p>Another takeaway from MisfitConf via <a href="http://www.twitter.com/jfm">Joshua Fields Millburn</a> was simply &#8220;sit in the chair&#8221; and get through the drudgery. What sounds simple is not so! At least for me :)</p>

<p>So this post is a stake in the ground; A renewed commitment to sit in the chair and get through the drudgery. To ensure one day I can look back at what I&#8217;ve done rather than think of what I should have done.</p>

    <link href="http://www.gerlandopiro.com/2013/04/16/lessconf-2013-how-less-was-more/"/>
    <updated>2013-04-16T21:21:00-07:00</updated>
    <id>http://www.gerlandopiro.com/2013/04/16/lessconf-2013-how-less-was-more</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This weekend I was fortunate enough to attend LessConf in Panama City, Florida. What I experienced was a conference unlike any I have attended to date. A conference in which the hierarchy of organizer/speaker/attendee did not exist and where VC funded CEOs, bootstrappers, and dreamers alike were welcomed. A conference with a <em>genuine</em> sense of community in which everyone was given a safe harbor to show vulnerablity and discuss their experiences no matter how difficult they may be. This being the final LessConf a lot of people I spoke with were left wondering, &#8220;Where can we go that recreates this experience next year?&#8221;</p>

<p>Unfortunately no such place exists. <a href="http://www.twitter.com/stevenbristol">Steve</a> and <a href="http://www.twitter.com/allanbranch">Allan</a> created an event that came from the heart and reflected their unique personalities and values. These attributes showed themselves in large ways, such as Allan hosting 200 people (many like myself whom he had never met) at his house; and subtle ways such as Steve, not a small guy, going topless on the beach and encouraging others to do so.</p>

<p>There are countless intangibles that align to create a true sense of community among strangers, but four notable traits stand out as ones that increased the sense of community at LessConf.</p>

<h2>Less Information</h2>

<p>No speaker list, talk topics, or venue locations were released before or during LessConf. For social events the posted schedule simply listed &#8220;Secret Adventures&#8221;. As such, attendees came into the event with no preconceptions about who was talking, what their story were, where they were going to go, or what they were going to do. LessConf became a mysterious adventure for everyone involved. The lack of information sparked conversations and rumors among attendees that added to the fun and the sense of comradery as people tried to figure out what was going on.</p>

<h2>Less Distraction</h2>

<p>Intentional or not, the hotel chosen for LessConf lacked wifi. During the first day of talks, everyone was told to leave their laptops at the hotel though the venue <em>did</em> have wifi. When gripes started from a few that connected to the anemic network, Steve took to the stage and bluntly stated that he didn&#8217;t care about the wifi and that people shouldn&#8217;t be on their laptops anyway; and he was right. The lack of distractions during talks ensured that people were listening. The lack of distractions at all other times made people fully present for social interactions.</p>

<h2>Less Guarded</h2>

<p>Mixed in with the business talks were a number of extremely personal stories of adversity and triumph. <a href="http://www.twitter.com/ajleon">AJ Leon</a> shared how he found his true path in life by throwing away a lucrative career in the financial industry for a nomadic lifestyle traveling the world. <a href="http://www.twitter.com/ryanevans">Ryan Evans</a> discussed being jailed for insider trading in extreme detail. And <a href="http://www.twitter.com/greggyb">Greg Baugues</a> discussed his struggles with ADHD and Bipolarism. Each speaker&#8217;s story displayed vulnerability, strength, and perseverance that opened up everyone in attendance to converse on a deeper level and to share their own trials and tribulations.</p>

<h2>More Family</h2>

<p>LessConf was also unique in that the organizers and speakers had their families present. For many of us, family and quality of life are our motivation for working so hard. Seeing kids, spouses, and moms participating as integral members of the conference put everything into perspective and brought a warmth missing from other events.</p>

<h2>The Result</h2>

<p>Much of the value of a conference comes from the network of personal connections that are built. Allan and Steve crafted a place for those connections to happen at a faster pace and on a deeper level than any other conference I have attended prior. It&#8217;s something other conference organizers should aspire to. Not everything needs to be orderly and completely professional. There&#8217;s room for fun, and magic occurs in the presence of uncertainty. It&#8217;s sad to know LessConf is no more, but I&#8217;m appreciative for the time that was spent and the friendships I&#8217;ve made. Less was so much more than I can fully put into words.</p>

    <link href="http://www.gerlandopiro.com/2013/03/23/your-pitch-sucks/"/>
    <updated>2013-03-23T22:58:00-07:00</updated>
    <id>http://www.gerlandopiro.com/2013/03/23/your-pitch-sucks</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Sometimes selecting a software vendor is as simple as filling out a couple of online forms and hitting the ground running. Other purchases, such as ones with long contracts or high fees, require a bit more due diligence which normally comes in the form of an in person meeting. Unfortunately many of these meetings are a complete waste of time because of a crucial flaw in perspective.</p>

<h2>That&#8217;s so typical</h2>

<p>Here&#8217;s a typical pitch that occurs in conference rooms  everyday, see if it rings a bell. You&#8217;ve received a lead through your inbound channel and after some back and forth you&#8217;ve finally got an in person meeting with your prospect.</p>

<p>Upon arriving at your prospect&#8217;s office you make friendly introductions as you attach your laptop to the meeting room projector and fire up Power Point or Keynote.</p>

<p>Your presentation starts off with a generic stock image and copy explaining how things have changed in the &#8220;new world&#8221;. Next slide shows a leaky sales funnel complimented by a stock image of confused business person.</p>

<p>Next we see a chart and some venn diagrams. One shows how progressive business people are dealing with this &#8220;new world&#8221;. Now that venn diagram is overlaid with your product and how it helps every aspect of every problem ever known in business.</p>

<p>Everything is &#8220;higher&#8221;, &#8220;bigger&#8221;, &#8220;in the hundreds of thousands&#8221;. Your product is described with mystical jargon such as &#8220;machine learning&#8221; and top it off listing the &#8220;potential impact&#8221; to be 100%, 300%, 10x improvements.</p>

<p>Finishing up, you thank your audience and ask the ones who are still paying attention, if they have any questions.</p>

<h2>Wake me when it&#8217;s over</h2>

<p>If your pitch is anything like that, it sucks. Why? Because your presenting from the perspective of <em>your business</em> and not your prospect&#8217;s. In delivering a boilerplate presentation you missed out on an opportunity to speak directly your prospect&#8217;s pain points, and the full value your product can provide. You need to do better, otherwise you are just wasting hours of life that will never be recovered.</p>

<p>So how do you fix your pitch? It&#8217;s simple, just ask! Once your initial pleasantries are taken care of ask your prospect what they already know about your product. Listen to what they have to say and note where it differs from what you expected them to say. Next ask what business problems they are trying to solve with your product.</p>

<h2>And like magic&#8230;</h2>

<p>Now when you pitch make sure to reenforce the positive aspects your prospect already knew about and fill in the areas they were unaware of. Highlight direct examples of how your product can address the business problems they&#8217;ve brought up as well as ones they might not have considered.</p>

<p>By stepping outside of your world view and looking at things from the prospect&#8217;s perspective you&#8217;ll deliver a more effective pitch. One with an engaged prospect because instead of talking about solving the world&#8217;s problems, you&#8217;re talking about solving <strong>their</strong> problems.</p>

    <link href="http://www.gerlandopiro.com/2013/03/13/did-refer-dot-ly-pivot-out-of-zombie-startup-status/"/>
    <updated>2013-03-13T09:07:00-07:00</updated>
    <id>http://www.gerlandopiro.com/2013/03/13/did-refer-dot-ly-pivot-out-of-zombie-startup-status</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Danielle Morrill recently <a href="http://www.daniellemorrill.com/2013/03/zombie-startups">wrote about zombie startups</a> in reference to  Referly&#8217;s <a href="https://refer.ly/please-read-referly-discontinuing-rewards-paying-existing-links-through-march-31st/c/67f9d3fa890311e2bfbf22000a1db8fa#comments-container">pivot</a> from an affiliate link enabler to a blogging platform.</p>

<p>Refer.ly launched in June 2012 as a Y Combinator backed startup that made it easy for anyone to create and share affiliate links. It&#8217;s a novel idea but parallels can be drawn to Gumroad in that the main business model is an add-on service with extremely small margins. As I wrote in my <a href="http://www.gerlandopiro.com/2013/02/06/do-we-need-yet-another-stripe-checkout-app">analysis of Gumroad and other Stripe payment apps</a>, making a decent revenue stream, in this case one that can pay staff <em>and</em> satisfy investors, is extremely difficult unless you attain moonshot levels of growth.</p>

<p>In the Danielle&#8217; zombie post she illustrates the point, although not directly. Refer.ly&#8217;s <a href="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8527/8545783275_14ae3b7e75_o.png">visitor growth</a> has been robust, but revenue was not. Clearly a change needed to be made to align their business with where they were gaining traction, unfortunately I think they&#8217;ve put themselves into a weak position but pivoting into yet another blogging platform. They&#8217;re entering a crowded market littered with high profile casualties such as <a href="https://blog.posterous.com/thanks-from-posterous">Posterous</a>, they still have no clear revenue model, and their new tagline, &#8220;A new kind of magazine for thoughtful shoppers.&#8221;, could only be more nondescript with significant effort.</p>

<p>When a startup pivots from a questionable revenue model to one reliant on page views and a sales you have to wonder how long until they pivot again or sell themselves as an aquihire.</p>

<p>One wonders if Refer.ly could have been successful if they had not taken the VC funded, quick growth approach. Fatwallet and RetailMeNot were both bootstrapped and generate revenue from affiliate fees. Without the pressures of VC money to grow fast or die, both grew organically and eventually sold for large sums of money.</p>

<p>In building my own product, a <a href="http://www.allthetags.com">tag management service</a> for online marketers, I have learned a lot by simply observing the path others have chosen. While I don&#8217;t agree with Refer.ly&#8217;s current course I appreciate how transparent they have been in sharing their experiences and hope it encourages more start ups to follow.</p>

    <link href="http://www.gerlandopiro.com/2013/03/07/gems-to-use-when-crafting-a-rails-mvp/"/>
    <updated>2013-03-07T09:19:00-08:00</updated>
    <id>http://www.gerlandopiro.com/2013/03/07/gems-to-use-when-crafting-a-rails-mvp</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>When creating a new web application there&#8217;s some basic functionality that you will probably want to add and get out of the way so you can start building out your core business logic. A lot of that functionality can be found pre-baked in the RubyGems ecosystem but the overwhelming number of gems, 52k and counting, makes it hard to know what to use and what&#8217;s crap. Here&#8217;s a list of useful gems to get your app bootstrapped so the real work can begin.</p>

<h2>Authentication</h2>

<p>Almost every web application needs user authentication and authorization capabilities. The gems below make it easy.</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://rubygems.org/gems/devise">Devise</a></strong>: Devise is a flexible authentication solution that makes it easy to add user registration and login capabilities to your app. Devise has built-in Omniauth support so you can quickly integrate with 3rd parties such as <a href="https://github.com/arunagw/omniauth-twitter">Twitter</a>, <a href="https://github.com/mkdynamic/omniauth-facebook">Facebook</a>, and just about <a href="https://github.com/intridea/omniauth/wiki/List-of-Strategies">everyone else</a>.</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://rubygems.org/gems/cancan">CanCan</a></strong>: CanCan is an authorization solution that works well with Devise and makes implementing access roles easy. All roles are defined in an Ability class that works with your User attributes to allow/deny access to your controller actions.</p>

<h2>Upload management</h2>

<p>If your users want to contribute assets, let them!</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://rubygems.org/gems/paperclip">Paperclip</a></strong>: Paperclip makes adding files to models relatively simple. You can configure image files for post-processing with Imagemagick. And out of the box Paperclip supports local file, S3, and fog storage with Azure and Dropbox available as add-on gems.</p>

<p><em>(alternative)</em> <strong><a href="https://rubygems.org/gems/carrierwave">CarrierWave</a></strong>: I have not used CarrierWave yet since Paperclip gets the job done. I&#8217;ve heard some say they prefer it over Paperclip so it&#8217;s worth checking out if Paperclip doesn&#8217;t float your boat.</p>

<h2>Payment Processing</h2>

<p>What&#8217;s the point in having customers if you can&#8217;t bill them?</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://rubygems.org/gems/stripe">Stripe</a></strong>: <a href="https://stripe.com/">Stripe</a> refers to itself as themselves as &#8220;Payments for developers&#8221; and so it&#8217;s fitting that they have an excellent api and robust tools to make it easy to integrate. You can also allow your customers to take payments through your site, although they need to have a Stripe account as well.</p>

<p><em>(alternative)</em> <strong><a href="http://rubygems.org/gems/activemerchant">Active Merchant</a></strong>: If you want to support multiple payment processors Active Merchant is the way to go. It provides an abstraction layer that supports a ridiculous amount of <a href="https://github.com/Shopify/active_merchant/wiki/gatewayfeaturematrix">gateways</a>. Active Merchant was a direct extraction from <a href="http://www.shopify.com">Shopify</a> so it&#8217;s been &#8216;battle-tested&#8217;.</p>

<h2>Frontend</h2>

<p>These make life easier for developers writing the view layer, and for users submitting text content.</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://rubygems.org/gems/haml">Haml</a></strong>: <a href="http://haml.info">Haml</a> is an alternative syntax for html that, in my opinion, is WAY better to work with than plain HTML. Unlike HTML it&#8217;s whitespace sensitive and does not require closing tags. This does a good job of enforcing proper formatting habits and removes the mental overhead of closing tags in your more heavily nested pieces of layout.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve interacted with some that absolutely hate Haml so it&#8217;s certainly a  personal preference, but I would suggest you give it a chance.</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://rubygems.org/gems/github-markdown">github-markdown</a></strong>: Markdown is a lightweight syntax that makes writing and formatting text easy. Github&#8217;s variant adds a few changes to traditional <a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown">Markdown</a> syntax and, since they use it extensively on Github.com, it should be well supported for the foreseeable future.</p>

<h2>SEO</h2>

<p>The grey area of the web&#8230;</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://rubygems.org/gems/friendly_id">Friendly Id</a></strong>: Rails surprisingly does not come out of the box with SEO friendly urls. Friendly Id fixes this by giving human-friendly strings to your data objects. You can choose one of the existing attributes in your model or pass in a generated slug. This is super handy if you want to have public, but obfuscated, urls.</p>

<h3>What are your picks?</h3>

<p>This is far from an exhaustive list, but it covers the gems I use most frequently. Now it&#8217;s your turn, <a href="http://www.twitter.com/gpxl">let me know</a> what gems you use to bootstrap your MVPs.</p>

    <id>http://www.gerlandopiro.com/2013/02/27/lesson-learned-one-month-into-the-5-dollars-web-app-challenge</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>It&#8217;s been one month since <a href="http://www.gerlandopiro.com/2013/01/27/starting-the-5-dollars-web-app-challenge">I challenged myself</a> to launch a product with the goal of generating $5 in profit. I&#8217;m still in the research and planning phase, but I&#8217;ve already learned a valuable lesson for making progress in the early days of a new product.</p>

<h2>Share Early</h2>

<p>I have never had a hard time discussing product ideas with friends and colleagues, but when it came to soliciting feedback on my web app challenge I hesitated. My idea wasn&#8217;t fully fleshed out and I was worried I would be bothering people I respected with a half baked idea.</p>

<p>Regardless, I asked a few friends and colleagues to review my product idea and tried to validate the pain point I was trying to address. It only took a few conversations to realize that I needed improvement in how I communicated what the product did and what value it provided.</p>

<p>The great thing is that a few people stuck it through and helped  me iterate until my messaging was much stronger. Now I have a product pitch almost ready to test against a larger audience, but even more valuable are the connections I&#8217;ve strengthened with people I trust.</p>

    <id>http://www.gerlandopiro.com/2013/02/16/overcoming-introversion-through-writing</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Ever since I was a kid I have found communication difficult. I avoid picking up phone calls from unknown numbers and I stumble over words when talking with friends as I am constantly searching for the right way to say something <em>while I&#8217;m in the middle of saying it!</em> Now that I&#8217;m making an effort to document <a href="http://www.gerlandopiro.com/2013/01/27/starting-the-5-dollars-web-app-challenge">my experience building a web app</a>, it&#8217;s become clear that writing is a wonderful outlet for improving confidence in communicating and overcoming introversion.</p>

<p>In his book <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Influence-Psychology-Persuasion-Business-Essentials/dp/006124189X">Influence: The Psychology of Persuasion</a></em>, author Dr. Cialdini outlines six weapons of influence that are commonly used to create desired outcomes in their targets. These &#8220;weapons&#8221; trigger desired reactions due to cultural and social norms that subtly control our decision making habits. One such weapon, commitment and consistency, is described with the observation, &#8220;Once we have made a choice or taken a stand, we will encounter personal and interpersonal pressures to behave consistently with that commitment.&#8221; That is, once we have made a decision or taken action, we are predisposed to maintain that direction or ideal. Writing about an idea triggers creates and internal commitment and a need for consistency regardless of wether or not you believe what is written.</p>

<p>The knowledge of this behavior was used to great effect in World War II to gather secret information from American POWs held in China. Rather than torture and threaten their prisoners, the Chinese army would persuade them to write a statement that sympathized with China&#8217;s world view. This simple act of writing an idea down, an act of compliance, triggered a commitment to the idea. The need for consistency ensured that subsequent requests for compliance were accepted with greater and greater ease to the point where POWs freely shared military secrets with their enemy.</p>

<p>If commitment and consistency can have such a strong effect on American POWs, imagine what it could do if applied for self-betterment. It&#8217;s no accident that the very first post to this blog was a declaration of intent, to create a revenue generating web application. The act of writing and committing to an idea is a strong trigger and sharing that idea publicly deepens the commitment. Once that is achieved, the consistency principle ensures the need for follow through.</p>

<p>Overcoming introversion is difficult, but writing can be a powerful tool for self motivation. So take a stand on something, write it down, and share it with others. You may be surprised at the results.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Wouldn&#8217;t it be awesome to create a service that would make it easy for anyone to easily sell digital goods online? That&#8217;s the thought that motivated me to start the <a href="http://www.gerlandopiro.com/2013/01/27/starting-the-5-dollars-web-app-challenge">$5 Web App Challenge</a>. But as I researched the market, doubt crept in. The ease with which a web application can be wrapped around <a href="https://stripe.com/">Stripe</a>&#8217;s payment api has already caused a mini boom in such services. With established players such as <a href="https://gumroad.com">GumRoad</a>, <a href="https://sellfy.com">Sellfy</a>, <a href="https://spacebox.io">Space Box</a>, and numerous others quickly crowding the space I began to wonder… do we really need another Stripe checkout app?</p>

<p>The appeal of creating such a site is strong as it fits a number of criteria I was looking towards when envisioning an app. The heavy lifting, payment processing, is off loaded to a third party. The MVP for the app is very narrow in scope. The market opportunity has been validated by the funding and competition already in the space. And there is clearly a need for such services in the number of <a href="https://gumroad.com/l/QVGo">high</a> <a href="https://sellfy.com/p/5ct4">profile</a> <a href="https://gumroad.com/l/DesigningWebApplications">creatives</a> already using them.</p>

<p>However, it&#8217;s not all unicorns and rainbows. The fees charged in this niche are extremely low, 1-2% per transaction (on top of Stripe&#8217;s 2.9% + $0.30 fee). A back of the napkin calculation shows that a run rate of nearly $2.5-5M is required to earn $50k/yr. With little to differentiate each other it will be difficult for any one service to charge a higher fee. That being the case, I would expect funded companies in this group to build their own payment systems to capture the 2.9% currently going to Stripe while continuing to target the general market for growth. The smaller players will need to go niche in an attempt to raise fees.</p>

<p>So no, the world does not need another Stripe landing page service, at least not one by me! Accepting this was tough as it set me back to square one with no idea of where to start. But doing so allowed new and better ideas to grow.</p>

    <id>http://www.gerlandopiro.com/2013/02/04/minimalist-blogging-with-ia-writer-octopress-and-s3</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>As I alluded to in my <a href="http://www.gerlandopiro.com/2013/01/27/starting-the-5-dollars-web-app-challenge">$5 Web App Challenge</a> post, I have not been an active writer in the past. In years past, I&#8217;ve tried nearmly every blogging platform available; from hosted platforms like Blogger and Tumblr, to self hosted apps like Drupal and WordPress. Nothing seemed to click and I&#8217;d find myself <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/yak_shaving">yak shaving</a> instead of writing. Every time I would get frustrated and lose inspiration and motivation. The solution, I found recently, was to embrace constraints and simplify.</p>

<p>My current &#8220;blogging stack&#8221; consists of IA Writer, Octopress, and Amazon S3. It&#8217;s a developer friendly set up so non-techies might have to learn new tricks, but learning how to DIY is in itself very rewarding. In this post break down how each layer in the stack helps me work faster, run cheaper, and stay focused on writing.</p>

<h3>The Editor: IA Writer</h3>

<p>The biggest improvement in my ability to write has been finding an editor that suited me well. <a href="http://www.iawriter.com">IA Writer</a> is a wonderfully simple iOS and OSX text editor built for the sole purpose of distraction free writing. The application has practically no chrome and few features, but the features it <em>does</em> have are extremely handy. First off is <strong>focus mode</strong>, this feature allows you to focus on the current sentence by greying out all surrounding text. Files can be saved to iCloud you can write and edit on either iOS or OSX whenever inspiration hits. The iOS version adds special keys to ease navigating through documents by word or character.</p>

<p>Most important in my mind is that IA Writer supports <a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax#overview">Markdown formatted documents</a>. This last feature is pretty awesome as the blog software I use, Octopress, also supports Markdown. This shared feature means you can easily cut and paste documents into an Octopress file or <em>edit your Octopress files directly with IA Writer</em>. IA Writer has a preview window so you can be sure your Markdown renders as you expect it to.</p>

<h3>The Blog: Octopress</h3>

<p>In keeping with the theme of simplicity, I prefer <a href="http://octopress.org">Octopress</a> as my blogging platform. Most blog platforms, such as Wordpress, are delivered as web applications. In contrast, Octopress is a static file compiler that generates your entire site on your local computer <em>before</em> pushing to a web server. Octopress does not require a web application to deliver or manage content and as such, benefits from better security, faster response times, and much lower web server requirements.</p>

<p>Octopress posts are simple text files that can be formatted with Markdown syntax and can be edited in any text editor. Site generation and web server deployment are managed through scripted Rake tasks.</p>

<p>Since the output of Octopress is static html and css, all you need is a web service that can handle static files, and that&#8217;s where Amazon S3 comes in.</p>

<h3>The Web Host: Amazon S3</h3>

<p><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/s3">Amazon S3</a> has an intentionally minimal feature set for storing and retrieving static content. It&#8217;s very robust and extremely cost efficient with rates currently at $0.095/mo. for a GB of storage and $0.01 per 10,000 GET requests which means you can run a pretty well trafficked site for only pennies a month. Amazon consistently improves service and prices in their efforts to dominate market share, so  S3&#8217;s value over time will only increase.</p>

<p>Octopress does not currently support deployments to S3 by default, but it&#8217;s <a href="https://github.com/imathis/octopress/pull/107">coming soon</a> and there are some <a href="http://www.jerome-bernard.com/blog/2011/08/20/quick-tip-for-easily-deploying-octopress-blog-on-amazon-cloudfront">good articles</a> on how to DIY it for the impatient.</p>

<h3>Wrapping Up</h3>

<p>My writing efforts are still in the nascent stage, but I&#8217;m confident I have finally have a set of tools that match my preferred way of working. Embracing constraints and using a few simple tools has allowed me to focus on the task of writing and to publish on a reliable, robust web host for pennies a month.</p>
