      <p>
        This was a multi-department rebranding effort that included a complete backend overhaul from Rails to Jekyll. My responsibilities included definition and set up of the backend services, front-end development, and migration of content from the previous Rails CMS.

        A promotional site for Engine Yard's yearly Distill conference. This was built using Jekyll and supported by a small Rails app to process speaker proposals. My responsibilities included set up of the backend services, front-end development, and Rails development.

        Here's a Wordpress site complimented by a small Rails app to process Leap Night submissions.

      <p>
        This is a little Rails app running I built as a first step in a <a href="http://sass-lang.com">Sass</a> refactoring tool, but I ran out of steam/interest before going any further. It's ugly and buggy, but it's still interesting to see people from all over the world add sites to the list of submissions.
