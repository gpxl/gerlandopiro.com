## Welcome Creatives!

It looks like my hastily written sponsorship message was interesting enough to lure you to my site. I wrote it with basically no clue what I was going to do with this page and to be perfectly honest, I still don't.

What I do know is that I'm very interested in entrepreneurship and I love connecting with others and helping people out. I've been a web developer most of my working years and I curate music videos at [AttackandSustain.com](http://www.attackandsustain.com).

I know my sponsorship message mentioned starting a business from scratch, but I've yet to have a spark of inspiration to create the next IWearYourShirt so the current plan is to work on small projects that align with my interests until something takes hold. First up is a book for aspiring web developers, with a twist.

The book I want to write for developers is non technical and focuses on the people side of working in technology. It will be a guide for building a fulfilling career and becoming a positive contributing member of the development community.

Whether you're an aspiring developer, currently a developer, or just curious, I'd love to have you in my early beta review group. Please sign up below and I'll be in touch.
