Since launching [Teachery](https://www.teachery.co), one of the recurring issues we’ve had has been monitoring real-time customer conversion and retention info. At this early stage in our the app’s development, Jason and I want to know about every new customer transaction **and** we want to be able to follow up in a timely manner.

The current state of the Stripe ecosystem is such that there are **a lot** of analytics services out there (my favorite being [Baremetrics](https://www.baremetrics.com)) but not much in the way of real-time notifications (from what I could find). We’ve built a few alerting mechanisms within the Teachery app itself, but instead of building event more within Teachery, I’m extracting the code out into a separate app that any Stripe user can use to gain immediate, tailored, insight into what’s going on in their Stripe account.

The test case for this new will be Teachery itself along with any beta users that surface along the way. If you’d like to be included in the beta [get in touch](mailto:gerlando@gmail.com)! Otherwise, stay tuned for more information on what the app will look like as well as the long-term vision for where the app will go in the future.
