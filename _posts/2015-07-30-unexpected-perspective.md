> A quick recap&hellip; I&#39;m participating in Gumroad&#39;s Small Product Lab, a challenge to develop and launch a product in 10 days. I&#39;m going to be launching a t-shirt brand! This post is part 4. You can catch up by reading earlier entries [here](/2015/07/28/one-small-step.html), [here](/2015/07/29/spl-day-2--planning.html), and [here](http://gerlandopiro.com/2015/07/30/hitting-a-rough-patch.html).

Day 4 of the [Small Product Lab](https://gumroad.com/smallproductlab) was relatively mellow. The goal was to start marketing efforts by sharing something. Since I&#39;ve already been sharing on this site as well as [Twitter](https://www.twitter.com/gpxl), [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/gerlando.piro), and [Instagram](https://instagram.com/gerlandop), I felt like I had the goal accomplished be default.

The biggest event of the day had nothing to do with the SPL at all. Greenpeace was in Portland blocking a Shell Oil Icebreaker from heading up to Alaska to support drilling in the Arctic. They did this by hanging off the St. John&#39;s Bridge, located right next to Cathedral Park. What a great excuse to take the family for a picnic lunch!

Now, I&#39;ve always had mixed feelings about Greenpeace but the display of determination, will, and community that was on display was awe inspiring. Here I am worried about sharing my ideas and pursuing my dreams in an online forum and these people are risking life, limb, ridicule, and arrest, for what they believed in. Fire and rescue also risked life and limb getting the protesters down. All the while both sides kept level heads and remained peaceful. I gained a higher level of respect for Greenpeace, Portland Police, Portland Fire and Rescue, and the Coast Guard for all their accomplishments today. In contrast, launching a product is a small, safe endeavor.

<span style="font-size: 1.8rem; letter-spacing: 0.01rem; line-height: 1.75em;">On the product side of things, I was able to finalize the artwork for the launch t-shirt and print films. I originally screwed up the color </span><span style="font-size: 1.8rem; letter-spacing: 0.01rem; line-height: 1.75em;">palette so a lot of work was required to get everything to fit into a one color print. I won&#39;t know if prints correctly until I actually get it down with some ink, I&#39;m a bit concerned that my screen mesh isn&#39;t fine enough for what I want to do, but I&#39;ll deal with that another day</span><span style="font-size: 1.8rem; letter-spacing: 0.01rem; line-height: 1.75em;">. The other big accomplishment today was that I finally got a step wedge test completed.</span><span style="font-size: 1.8rem; letter-spacing: 0.01rem; line-height: 1.75em;"> N</span><span style="font-size: 1.8rem; letter-spacing: 0.01rem; line-height: 1.75em;">ow I know my exposure time, screens have been emulsified, and films have been printed. We&#39;re getting close to the ultimate moment of truth, printing artwork!</span>

In contrast to yesterday, I&#39;m now feeling confident I can get this thing done. If self-doubt and fear creep back in, I&#39;ll just think back to those protesters and rescue teams hanging 200 feet above the Willamette and remember I have nothing to fear.
