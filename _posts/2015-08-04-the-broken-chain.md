> A quick recap&hellip; I&#39;m participating in Gumroad&#39;s Small Product Lab, a challenge to develop and launch a product in 10 days. I&#39;m going to be launching [a t-shirt brand](https://gumroad.com/gpxl/follow)! This post is part 6. You can catch up by reading entries [1](/2015/07/28/one-small-step.html), [2](/2015/07/29/spl-day-2--planning.html), [3](/2015/07/30/hitting-a-rough-patch.html), [4](/2015/07/31/unexpected-perspective.html), and [5](/2015/08/01/a-bit-of-burnout.html).

Sigh, As the end of the Small Product Lab draws near, I&#39;ve neglected to keep writing about what&#39;s happening behind the scenes. Here&#39;s a quick update so I can stop feeling this nagging feeling that I&#39;m dropping the ball. The past couple of day&#39;s SPL goals have been to work on pricing and launch plans. My pricing was set based on the average going rate for a printed t-shirt. It&#39;s easy enough to add promotional discounts as needed, but I didn&#39;t want to anchor low and need to adjust higher. I&#39;m going to be using high quality, super comfortable shirts and the print quality will be as high as anything available through other retail outlets, so why sell things short?

I had yet to set up any wholesale accounts and figured I could pick up some cheap t-shirts to run test prints on. Chalk it up to years of avoiding retail, but I had no idea even the cheapest Hanes blanks retailed for over $9 (with coupon)! I promptly hit the internet and got everything in order to get some wholesale accounts created. Now I&#39;m just waiting for my first order to arrive. Much higher quality shirts at much lower prices. This should have been one of my first steps!

My launch plan consists of outreach to the various online communities I&#39;m a part of, as well as direct outreach to individuals. I&#39;m curious to see what the response is. I figure what I&#39;m doing will probably _not_ resonate with a large number of folks, but I won&#39;t know unless I ask right?

Oh, one more thing. I came up with a name! Going forward, âŒ˜ will be known as Points of Interest!
