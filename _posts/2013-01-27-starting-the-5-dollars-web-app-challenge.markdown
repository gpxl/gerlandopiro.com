__That's not a typo in the title. I'm seriously challenging myself to pull in $5 in profit this year. Keep reading to hear why I consider this far from a trivial goal.__

I've been working as a web developer at various startups since the late 90s, and for many years I've dreamt of creating and selling a product of my own. I consider my design and dev skills to be decent but to date I have failed to launch anything of substance to call my own. 

The cause is certainly not from a lack of good role models. I've been lucky enough to work beside some wonderfully smart and ambitious people that have gone on to do, and continue to do, great things. I've followed the rise of people such as [Amy Hoy](http://unicornfree.com) since her Rails cheat sheet days, and more recently [Nathan Barry](http://nathanbarry.com) with his Designing Web Applications book.

The new year brought upon a good deal of introspection as I read through a couple of books on the Lean Startup Methodology and behavioral marketing. I came to realize that I've been focused on the wrong things when it comes to building products and I let fear of ridicule hold me back from sharing my thoughts and experiences. 

A couple of timely posts about [fear](http://lesseverything.com/blog/archives/2013/01/24/fear-just-refocuses-itself-1) and [regret](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5119213) have solidified my resolve to finally take action and launch something.

So taking a page from Nathan's [$5k Web App Challenge](http://nathanbarry.com/starting-web-app-challenge), I've come up with a challenge that I like to call the $5 Web App Challenge. The goal of which is to create a product or service that generates $5 in profit by the end of the year.

It may sound like ridiculously low bar to set, but it will require me to complete three goals that have so far eluded me:

* Identifying a target customer
* Building an audience
* Creating something people are willing to pay for

I will be leaning (no pun intended) on the process outlined in Ash Maurya's [Running Lean](http://runninglean.co) as a starting point and intend to adjust accordingly as I figure out what does and does not work for me.

Additionally, I committing to writing about the experience along the way in the hopes that someone finds it useful and to improve my quality and confidence in public communication. If you've read this far down the page please use the links below to get in touch or to follow my progress.
