It's been a bit over a month since I started an experiment in mining Cryptocurrencies. One of the big questions I had going into it was wether or not mining could actually be profitable. In the time that I have been mining, daily payouts have been about 0.012 BTC/Mhs/day. That works out to about $10/day. In my [previous post](/2014/01/02/a-small-mining-adventure-the-beginning) I mentioned a 1.2Mh/s rig cost $1260 to put together so, at the current average rate, my projection of a 4 month payback schedule was accurate.

Below is a chart of daily earnings since the beginning of the experiment.

You'll notice a pretty good rate of growth. That's because I not only finished the build of my first rig, I decided to add a second rig and effectively double my hash rate. There was an additional spike in the last few days due to growth in Dogecoin which increased payouts to 0.017 BTC/Mh/day. I don't expect this to last long term, but it's interesting because it's a common assumption that profitability should fall over time due to increased difficulty. At least over the short term, this is clearly not correct.
