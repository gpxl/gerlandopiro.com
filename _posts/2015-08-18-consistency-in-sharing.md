While participating in the Small Product Lab, I was posting to this site on a consistent basis. Since the lab ended, that cadence of posting has dropped to almost nothing. I'm falling back into old habits of working on projects and feeling like they're too early to show. That one more day of progress and I'll be ready to talk about them. Well that mindset has to stop if I'm going to make progress so... here's what I'm working on.

I'm continuing to develop potential designs for Points of Interest but I'm not sure when I'm going to make any of them available for sale. Having screen printing resources in house (literally) gives me the ability to produce new designs on a whim, but I don't want to expand the collection until I have logistics completely nailed down. So in the meantime, I'll probably just make some for myself and gauge the reaction from there. I'm also going to start posting some sketches and early revisions to share how designs develop overtime. 

I'm also starting to figure out more of the style I want to convey and it's leaning heavily towards minimalism. I've always been a fan of geometric shapes and that's coming through strong in just about everything that's being worked on right now. Most designs have been starting out as simple motifs based on an idea. They go through a stage of addition as I try to make them more "developed" which only seems to make things cluttered to the point where a lot of work needs to be subtracted to get to a better place. I suppose that's the process for now. I'm not fully in control of it, but at least I'm observant.
