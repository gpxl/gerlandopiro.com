As far as I remember, home life was unstable. My ideas of how people treat each other were guided by my parents who fought constantly, their fights with my older brother, and long stretches of TV. I was depressed, insecure and had a horrible outlook on the world around me. Until someone came along and sparked a light setting me on a path that lead me to where I am today, married with two wonderful kids and a solid group of friends.

But let’s start at the beginning. The earliest memories I have from childhood are of my dad and mom fighting to the point of violence. I cannot recall specifically living with both parents at the same time, but I know it must have happened as I can remember walking in on a fight that had gotten physical. I also recall being heartbroken seeing my dad tear to shreds a yellow baby chick stuffed animal he had bought my mom. The broken pieces an apt metaphor for their relationship and became even more apt when he stitched it back together upon seeing how upset I became. I treasured that little frankenstein chick. My parents would also fight with my brother who was forced out of our home at age sixteen. Screaming, doors slamming, and crying were the norm in my household.

School wasn’t much better. Teachers would single me out as a bad kid and made sure I was kept under close scrutiny. I once got punched by a girl in my class only to have my teacher tell me I must have done something to deserve it. I also was told I was always getting in trouble because my voice carried more than the other kids. I kid you not, my teachers were annoyed by my simple presence.

Once my parents got divorced I lived with my dad who would “encourage” me to go outside and play whenever he was home. I spent a lot of my time walking along the train tracks behind our apartment, catching lizards and flattening things on the tracks as trains flew by. I also enjoyed exploring the storm drain systems as you never knew where you would end up on the other side. By the time I had reached middle school I knew a whole system of shortcuts through my hometown. I could get all the way across town and never see another soul. It was nice being outside, much better than being home.

Home was always a dark place. When my parents were married there was constant fighting but after they divorced things got worse. Suddenly I was a latch key kid. My dad worked as much overtime as he could so during weekdays he would be sleeping when I left for school and wouldn’t return until 10 at night or later. My days were lonely as the TV and my cats were my only company. I actually once saw a neighbors baby choke to death from my balcony while firefighters tried to resuscitate it. I also experienced the 1989 Loma Preita quake alone in my living room. But most days I would simply make myself dinner, normally Ramen or a Hungry-Man and dread my dads arrival. Frustrated with his own place in life, my dad would come home and start yelling daily affirmations such as “You’re lazy”, “You’re never be anything”, “This is my house, if you don’t like it you can get the fuck out”. The funny thing is, I would have preferred to run away. If only I knew how.

Instead, my reaction was to make sure I was always in bed when he got home, feigning being asleep so he wouldn’t yell at me. Sometimes it would work, and sometimes the dishes left in the sink were just too much for him so he would wake me up and make sure I knew how worthless I was.

And true to his words, I became something worthless; an empty shell. Life held no joy for me and by the time I got to high school I had no friends, horrible grades, and no interests other than wasting away in front of a television; Just like my dad would do every chance he got. I tried fitting in and hanging out with various cliques but I always felt like I was on the outside looking in.

Thankfully there was someone that, for reasons unknown, actively tried to befriend me. I didn’t know it at the time, but that friendship was a turning point in my life.

Like me, he didn’t seem to fit into any of the high school cliques so we’d hangout a lot. Lunch would often be spent in the ice cream man’s truck. The ice cream man was a former high school attendee who found a way to extend his high school years by parking his ice cream truck across the street from the school to serve kids ice cream and creep on the teenage girls.

My newfound friend was always going on about going out to these underground parties called raves where people would break in to empty warehouses and play the worst music I had ever heard in my life. I had absolutely no interest in parties but eventually I relented since, let’s be honest, I had nothing else to do.

This was the early 90s and the scene was still in its early underground phase. Most parties were un-permitted and the first six events we went to were broken up by police before we arrived.

As two carless teenagers, this was heartbreaking. It was difficult to simply get a ride in those days and spending a night chasing down a goal that never materialized just sucked. I started to become affectionately known as the rave jinx. Somehow I was spreading whatever bad mojo I carried to those around me.

Then without notice, the stars aligned. A Rave Called Sharon was throwing a party in Half Moon Bay. My buddy persuaded a friend to make the hour long drive to the event to drop us off. We would be responsible for figuring out a way home in the morning, at the butt crack of dawn, in the middle of nowhere. So being the dumb feral kids we were, we said yes.

We had no idea what to expect when we got there. After an hour on the freeway we pulled off on a long dirt road. The area was pitch black and silent as we cruised down the road for what seemed like an eternity. Finally the path widened into a big valley and there it was. An electronic oasis tucked in the California hills with lasers fanning out overhead, a huge sound system, and thousands and thousands of people doing god knows what.

I don’t recall much of what happened that night except that something inside me woke up. Surrounded by an explosion of sound, light, and creative individuals; I found a bit of self confidence I had been lacking my entire life and I had found a group of people I could connect with.

I spent the next four years deeply immersing myself in the scene creating artwork for flyers, creating and running rave visuals, DJing, and helping friends throw events. Along the way I made thousands of friends, hundreds of which to this day form my core tribe, and it was at one of these events that I saw a girl that I instantly fell in love with. She was small, blonde, and had the same unhappy look I saw reflected in the mirror everyday of my life. I wanted to talk to her so badly, but instead I got trashed an passed out in a back room. My one other memory of the night was a brief moment of consciousness & seeing her looking down at me. First impressions have never been my strong point.

A few months later we ran into each other at another event. We talked for the first time and spent most of the evening together. My head was spinning in what I felt an out of body experience. Was it through my own sheer will and desire that she liked me? Not exactly. It took a couple of years of distance to bring us together again, but we’ve now been married almost thirteen years, creating two beautiful children along the way. Now I get to be the the father I never had and give them the childhood I always wished for.

Life’s an interesting set of twists and turns. You start off naked and crying, and sometimes you stay that way for a while. Sometimes a stranger becomes a friend and helps you in ways that are unimaginable. And with a bit of luck, you get a chance to fix the past.
