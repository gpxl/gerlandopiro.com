> We&#39;ve launched! Take a look at [our first product, The Launch Tee](http://pointsofinterest.clothing)

Launching a product, even a small one, is [hard work](/2015/08/01/a-bit-of-burnout.html). But as I found out, shipping a physical product brings a whole extra world of complications in the name of fulfillment and shipping. I also learned some practical lessons for launching any product.

Last Friday I announced my new t-shirt line, Points of Interest, to a few online communities with no clear expectations of what response to expect. There were a few bumps in the road, like not publishing the sales page before the launch announcement, forgetting to place a size option on the sales page, and not having one of the size options on hand for launch; but overall feedback was positive and I spent the day marvelling as orders started to come in. Since I was unsure of how the launch would go, I held off on printing shirts until the first day tally was complete and proceeded to print the shirts that night. With that task complete I decided to have a celebratory beer to cap off the night. Leaving shipping details to the next day.

The next morning I loaded up my order list in [Gumroad](https://gumroad.com) and immediately realized that Gumroad lacked fulfillment and shipping features that would have made my world a lot easier. Due to being under a self-imposed constraint to get shipments out the door quickly I took the obvious route (at the time) and fired up the USPS site and manually cut and pasted information to purchase shipping for each order. I then printed out all the shipping labels, packed each order, taped shipping labels to each package, and then cut and pasted the tracking information back into Gumroad. It&#39;s hard to explain how much of a pain in the ass this was.

It wasn&#39;t until later that I came upon a couple of [extremely](http://www.fullstopinteractive.com/blog/2010/12/so-you-want-to-make-t-shirts) [helpful](http://blog.unitedpixelworkers.com/2013/02/20/so-you-want-to-make-a-whole-bunch-of-t-shirts) [posts](https://cottonbureau.com/blog/so-you-want-to-make-even-more-t-shirts) from the Cotton Bureau folks that outline the various growing pains they suffered through as well as services that helped them (and others) get through it.

It&#39;s in those posts that I learned of ShipStation. A service that focuses on making fulfillment and shipping easier. I&#39;ve just signed up for ShipStation and will report back once I have some experience with it under my belt, but I&#39;m optimistic as nothing could be worse than than my current process!

So lessons learned from this experience?

*   Your product launch is just the beginning
*   Launch before you&#39;re ready (in reality you&#39;ll never be fully prepared)
*   Launch small to work out the kinks
*   Seek advice from more experienced vendors
*
