February was quite a busy month. My mining operation has doubled in size which brought about some growing pains due to the need for better heat and space management. I learned the value of USB GPU risers which allowed for better placement of GPUs allowing them to run cooler while also allowing a consolidation down to three motherboards!

Now the rigs are running at comfortable temperatures, but the room temperature is still too warm for comfort. Luckily there's an abundance of small room temperature management knowledge in the hydroponics community. After a bit of investigation, I now have a plan to better ventilate the basement once the hardware arrives.

This month my preferred mining pool, [Middlecoin](http://www.middlecoin.com), had a rough time with some horrible payouts leading to an exodus of miners. Almost overnight half the hash rate of the pool migrated to other pools such as [CleverMining](http://www.clevermining.com) and [WafflePool](http://www.wafflepool.com). I spent most of the month mining [MaxCoin](http://www.maxcoin.co.uk) which started off well but has seen a steady decline in value. Pump and dump you say?
Maxcoin was interesting in that it was a SHA-3 coin. The SHA-3 algorithm is less memory intensive and allowed for lower GPU temps and power usage. I'd like to see more alt-coins using SHA-3 but for now I've gone back to mining scrypt at CleverMining.

Overall profitability of GPU mining has been relatively stable with CleverMining showing a payout rate of 0.01130 BTC/day/MHs over the past 30 days.

In addition to mining on Clevermining, I've also started renting my rigs on [BetaRigs](https://www.betarigs.com) which had shown even larger returns. A high initial hash rate is crucial in generating buzz around new coins and pools so people involved in those activities are willing to pay above market rates to support their efforts. Pump and dump you say?

Below is a chart of daily earnings with January in blue and February in Green. The two dips in the middle of February were due to issues with the MiddleCoin pool. The dip at the end of the month was due to a combination of Maxcoin's decline and my rigs being rented which pushed a payout into the start of March.
