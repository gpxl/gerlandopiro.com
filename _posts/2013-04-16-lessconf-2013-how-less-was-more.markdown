This weekend I was fortunate enough to attend LessConf in Panama City, Florida. What I experienced was a conference unlike any I have attended to date. A conference in which the hierarchy of organizer/speaker/attendee did not exist and where VC funded CEOs, bootstrappers, and dreamers alike were welcomed. A conference with a _genuine_ sense of community in which everyone was given a safe harbor to show vulnerablity and discuss their experiences no matter how difficult they may be. This being the final LessConf a lot of people I spoke with were left wondering, "Where can we go that recreates this experience next year?"

Unfortunately no such place exists. [Steve](http://www.twitter.com/stevenbristol) and [Allan](http://www.twitter.com/allanbranch) created an event that came from the heart and reflected their unique personalities and values. These attributes showed themselves in large ways, such as Allan hosting 200 people (many like myself whom he had never met) at his house; and subtle ways such as Steve, not a small guy, going topless on the beach and encouraging others to do so.

There are countless intangibles that align to create a true sense of community among strangers, but four notable traits stand out as ones that increased the sense of community at LessConf.

##Less Information

No speaker list, talk topics, or venue locations were released before or during LessConf. For social events the posted schedule simply listed "Secret Adventures". As such, attendees came into the event with no preconceptions about who was talking, what their story were, where they were going to go, or what they were going to do. LessConf became a mysterious adventure for everyone involved. The lack of information sparked conversations and rumors among attendees that added to the fun and the sense of comradery as people tried to figure out what was going on. 

##Less Distraction

Intentional or not, the hotel chosen for LessConf lacked wifi. During the first day of talks, everyone was told to leave their laptops at the hotel though the venue _did_ have wifi. When gripes started from a few that connected to the anemic network, Steve took to the stage and bluntly stated that he didn't care about the wifi and that people shouldn't be on their laptops anyway; and he was right. The lack of distractions during talks ensured that people were listening. The lack of distractions at all other times made people fully present for social interactions.

##Less Guarded

Mixed in with the business talks were a number of extremely personal stories of adversity and triumph. [AJ Leon](http://www.twitter.com/ajleon) shared how he found his true path in life by throwing away a lucrative career in the financial industry for a nomadic lifestyle traveling the world. [Ryan Evans](http://www.twitter.com/ryanevans) discussed being jailed for insider trading in extreme detail. And [Greg Baugues](http://www.twitter.com/greggyb) discussed his struggles with ADHD and Bipolarism. Each speaker's story displayed vulnerability, strength, and perseverance that opened up everyone in attendance to converse on a deeper level and to share their own trials and tribulations.

##More Family

LessConf was also unique in that the organizers and speakers had their families present. For many of us, family and quality of life are our motivation for working so hard. Seeing kids, spouses, and moms participating as integral members of the conference put everything into perspective and brought a warmth missing from other events.

##The Result

Much of the value of a conference comes from the network of personal connections that are built. Allan and Steve crafted a place for those connections to happen at a faster pace and on a deeper level than any other conference I have attended prior. It's something other conference organizers should aspire to. Not everything needs to be orderly and completely professional. There's room for fun, and magic occurs in the presence of uncertainty. It's sad to know LessConf is no more, but I'm appreciative for the time that was spent and the friendships I've made. Less was so much more than I can fully put into words.
