One of the best things about web development, other than being able to work from anywhere, is the minimal requirements to get started. To get an idea of what's involved, I've listed the things I lean on daily as well as their associated costs. Since they tend to be long term purchases, I tend to splurge on hardware. I offset this by reducing expenses as much as possible in software and services.

##Hardware

__$1,449.00 - [13" Macbook Air](http://www.apple.com/macbook-air)__

There are many reasons for my preference for Apple products but a big one is the fact that OSX is based on Unix. This makes switching between development (OSX) and production (Linux) environments that much easier. My Macbook is probably spec'ed higher than it needs to be although the extra horsepower comes in handy for Photoshop and when compiling code.

##Development

__$7/mo. - [Github](https://www.github.com)__

Github is literally the center of all my development work. I use it as a source code repository, issue tracker, and web host.

__Free - [Github for Mac](https://mac.github.com)__

The Github client is great for managing local git repos. It fits pretty will with the 80/20 rule in that it covers most of the things you'll want to do in git. For the rest I still need to drop into the command line.

__$70 - [Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com)__

Sublime is my editor of choice, but that's largely due to familiarity. [Atom](https://atom.io) is an alternative editor that is just as good, if not better than, Sublime. Both Sublime and Atom build off the existing keyboard shortcuts in OSX and are extremely customizable to meet whatever preferences you may have.

__Free - [OSX Terminal](http://blog.teamtreehouse.com/introduction-to-the-mac-os-x-command-line)__

I spend __a lot__ of time in terminal. Whether it's viewing logs, managing remote and local servers, working with git, or simply moving files, terminal is where it gets done.

## Design

__$49.99/mo. [Photoshop](http://www.adobe.com/products/photoshop.html)__

I've been using Photoshop almost since I got my first computer. It's too expensive and too resource intensive for most web design work, But my employers have always paid the bill and it's pretty much a requirement if you work in an office with other designers. At $70, and recommended by [Jina Bolton](https://twitter.com/jina) (designer extraordinaire), [Sketch](http://bohemiancoding.com/sketch) looks like a wonderful alternative with a sharp focus on features built for web designers. If you're going solo, I'd give it a try.
 
## Communications

__Free - [Adium](https://adium.im)__

Adium is my IM client. Nothing special really.
 
__Free - [Slack](https://slack.com)__

Slack is the team chat service we use at Engine Yard. We switched from Campfire once 37Signals (now Basecamp) announced the end of support for all applications other than Basecamp. I find the UI to be painful to use & long for a third party client to provide an alternative.

## Misc.

__Free - [AlfredApp](http://www.alfredapp.com)__

Alfred allows you to find information on your Mac super fast. I mainly use it as an application launcher so I rarely have to use the Dock or Finder.

## That's all!

Ok, that's not really all as I also run every browser I can get my hands on, but that's a pretty accurate view of what's open on my laptop all day, every day. So what do you think? Is your daily toolset better than mine? [Tweet at me](https://www.twitter.com/gpxl) and let me know.
