> A quick recap&hellip; I&#39;m participating in Gumroad&#39;s Small Product Lab, a challenge to develop and launch a product in 10 days. I&#39;m going to be launching a t-shirt brand! This post is part 3. You can catch up by reading [part 1](/2015/07/28/one-small-step.html) and [part 2](/2015/07/29/spl-day-2--planning.html).

Day 3 of SPL had us create a landing page for our project and to start spreading the word over social media. This was going to be a cakewalk as I had already built out [my landing page](https://gumroad.com/gpxl/follow) the day before. I did revise the text some after discussing the open source aspect of the project with my friend Brian. I also later added an auto respond email for when people follow the project via [Gumroad Workflows](https://help.gumroad.com/customer/portal/articles/1814089-creating-workflows-to-send-automated-updates).

My plan for the remainder of the day was to fix up my artwork in preparation for printing films and to print a step wedge test so I know the exposure time to use when burning my screens. Yesterday I realized I had been designing with CMYK colors and relying on different layer types to create color variations in the artwork. I&#39;d need to change this to spot colors as I intend this initial print to be one color. Unfortunately I was unable to get this complete tonight so tomorrow I need to finish the artwork, print the films, AND burn the screens. It&#39;s not an overwhelming amount of work, but I do feel the creeping sensation of falling behind.

To make matters worse I was also unable to print the step wedge test as well. Donovon and I burned a test screen according to directions, but when we went to wash out the screen nothing came out! My initial thought was that the lights we were using were not completely UV free and that all of our emulsion was ruined. Not a good thing! I immediately grabbed another screen to burn another test and found the emulsion was still wet. In fact, all of my reminaing screens were wet. Now I think we had two problems compounding each other. There was light creeping into our dark area AND our screens weren&#39;t getting enough airflow. This is a big set back as we need to wait another day for the screens to dry to attempt the step wedge test again. I have all my fingers crossed that things go well. Even if tomorrow goes sideways, there&#39;s no path but the way forward.
> Resolution! After racking my brain for what went wrong, I figured out the real issue. When burning the screen I put the film between the screen and the exposure unit lid and not between the lights and the screen. You&#39;d be hard pressed to think of a more newbie level mistake than that. The good news is, the problem is solved and I can move forward with confidence again!
