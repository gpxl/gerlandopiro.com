It's been one month since [I challenged myself](http://www.gerlandopiro.com/2013/01/27/starting-the-5-dollars-web-app-challenge) to launch a product with the goal of generating $5 in profit. I'm still in the research and planning phase, but I've already learned a valuable lesson for making progress in the early days of a new product.

## Share Early

I have never had a hard time discussing product ideas with friends and colleagues, but when it came to soliciting feedback on my web app challenge I hesitated. My idea wasn't fully fleshed out and I was worried I would be bothering people I respected with a half baked idea.

Regardless, I asked a few friends and colleagues to review my product idea and tried to validate the pain point I was trying to address. It only took a few conversations to realize that I needed improvement in how I communicated what the product did and what value it provided.

The great thing is that a few people stuck it through and helped  me iterate until my messaging was much stronger. Now I have a product pitch almost ready to test against a larger audience, but even more valuable are the connections I've strengthened with people I trust.
