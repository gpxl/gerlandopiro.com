I learned at an early age that it's better to be alone than to be surrounded by people who would do harm. Even so, sometimes life leaves you no choice and conflict is unavoidable. When these situations arise, it's easy to get mired in negativity, anger, doubt, anxiety or even depression. But with a change in perspective and a lot of perseverance, you can bend the universe to your will and end up a stronger person for it.  

A few years ago I was recruited by a mentor of mine to work at a startup with him. He had built a wonderful team who all worked extremely well together and I looked forward to each workday. Unfortunately that all that changed within a few months with the hiring of a new head of marketing.

David was an extremely arrogant individual who used a mask of hubris to hide the true insecure self lying underneath. This insecurity led to him systematically firing everyone on the team, from the top down, replacing them with people he thought he could control. As the most junior member, watched for a full year as each team member started receiving poor performance reviews followed by increased workload demands leading to an eventual layoff. The entire year was miserable but I kept at it because I _needed_ this job. How would I support my family otherwise? Mental images of my family on the street stressed me to the point of uncontrollable shaking. Finally with everyone else fired, it was my turn.

It started predictably with a poor performance review, the first one I had ever received in my eleven year career. My manager became increasingly abusive, once calling me at four in the morning screaming that my performance was unacceptable. Next came the demand that I travel from Seattle to SF on a weekly basis until I had proved myself. The threat of constant travel and not being able to spend time with my kids was the tipping point. My view shifted from trying to hold on, to trying to escape.

It's a surprising thing when you view something from a different perspective, the universe tends to align to your new view. I started talking about my situation with others and I found an abundance of people willing to help me through my struggle with personal as well as professional and legal advice. The end result was I was able to start a short term contract as I was being laid off so I actually had a negative gap in unemployment. I also received a full two months severance so for a short time my income was the highest it had ever been, _as I was getting laid off!_ 

More opportunity arrived a couple months later when I was recruited by another mentor for a new start up. I went from miserable for a year to surrounded with abundance because I chose not to be kept down anymore. 

What happened to that paranoid, insecure head of marketing? He was replaced by one of his own hires a year later.

If you find yourself surrounded by negative, selfish people don't let them keep you in their grasp. Keep a positive mindset and share your story. It's a simple act that will uncover new avenues of support and abundance. Change your perspective, bend the universe, and watch the stars align.
