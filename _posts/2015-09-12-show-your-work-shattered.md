This is the first in an effort to show the process behind my artwork. I tend to gravitate towards minimal, monochromatic, geometric patterns and though the end result might not look like much, each measure of angles line width and color are carefully considered.

This work was inspired by the book [Ready Player One](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0307887448/tag=shnomo-20). The book centers around a treasure hunt based on 80s culture and there’s a reference to an old arcade game [Battlezone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battlezone_(1980_video_game)). The game used simple vector graphics to realize three dimensional shapes.

The vector landscape of the game became the basis for the first revision, although the “mountains” look more like pyramids.

From here I played around with different color combinations on the pyramid faces and their outlines. I found that removing the outlines allowed the triangles in the pyramids to stand out more. I didn’t want to repeat the dark on dark color scheme of [my first t-shirt design](https://gumroad.com/l/cmdlaunch) so the black was replaced with light blue.

With this design in hand, I ran a test print. I was happy with the color scheme but a couple of issues with the design stuck out to me. The extreme asymmetry of the pyramids simply looked “off” when rendered to a shirt. Additionally, the solid straight line anchoring the bottom of the pyramids was too rigid.

I had already considered asymmetry might be a problem so my solution came about rather quickly. Simply clone one of the pyramids!

Of course, we still have the solid line grounding the horizontal plane to solve. Enter the mangling stage wherein the design was cloned, rotated, reflected, broken apart, and put back together; largely in the state it was before, but also changed.

What started out as two simple vector mountains now looks more like an iceberg or crystal. Let’s print it!

I ran a single color test print to make sure further tweaking wasn’t required before I print out multiple screens for the various shades of blue. I’m \*super happy\* with how this iteration works on a t-shirt. So now it’s time to burn a couple of screens and print up some shirts!
