Sometimes selecting a software vendor is as simple as filling out a couple of online forms and hitting the ground running. Other purchases, such as ones with long contracts or high fees, require a bit more due diligence which normally comes in the form of an in person meeting. Unfortunately many of these meetings are a complete waste of time because of a crucial flaw in perspective.

## That's so typical

Here's a typical pitch that occurs in conference rooms  everyday, see if it rings a bell. You've received a lead through your inbound channel and after some back and forth you've finally got an in person meeting with your prospect.

Upon arriving at your prospect's office you make friendly introductions as you attach your laptop to the meeting room projector and fire up Power Point or Keynote.

Your presentation starts off with a generic stock image and copy explaining how things have changed in the "new world". Next slide shows a leaky sales funnel complimented by a stock image of confused business person.

Next we see a chart and some venn diagrams. One shows how progressive business people are dealing with this "new world". Now that venn diagram is overlaid with your product and how it helps every aspect of every problem ever known in business. 

Everything is "higher", "bigger", "in the hundreds of thousands". Your product is described with mystical jargon such as "machine learning" and top it off listing the "potential impact" to be 100%, 300%, 10x improvements.

Finishing up, you thank your audience and ask the ones who are still paying attention, if they have any questions.

## Wake me when it's over

If your pitch is anything like that, it sucks. Why? Because your presenting from the perspective of _your business_ and not your prospect's. In delivering a boilerplate presentation you missed out on an opportunity to speak directly your prospect's pain points, and the full value your product can provide. You need to do better, otherwise you are just wasting hours of life that will never be recovered.

So how do you fix your pitch? It's simple, just ask! Once your initial pleasantries are taken care of ask your prospect what they already know about your product. Listen to what they have to say and note where it differs from what you expected them to say. Next ask what business problems they are trying to solve with your product.

## And like magic...

Now when you pitch make sure to reenforce the positive aspects your prospect already knew about and fill in the areas they were unaware of. Highlight direct examples of how your product can address the business problems they've brought up as well as ones they might not have considered. 

By stepping outside of your world view and looking at things from the prospect's perspective you'll deliver a more effective pitch. One with an engaged prospect because instead of talking about solving the world's problems, you're talking about solving __their__ problems.
