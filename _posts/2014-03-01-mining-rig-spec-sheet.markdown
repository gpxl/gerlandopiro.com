If you are interested in building a mining rig but not sure where to start, things just got a lot easier.
Hereâ€™s my recommended spec sheet for a rig that, based on current market conditions, provides the best possible bang for the buck.
This build should cost about $1900, produce a hash rate of at least 2.5MH/s, and produce about $460/month.
It should draw about 1050 watts so it will work with any non shared 15 amp or greater circuit in your house.
If you are on a smaller budget you can start with only three GPUs and one PSU saving you $790 and leaving you with the option of expansion in the future.

Note: Prices are constantly in flux so the prices listed be low may not be completely accurate. But as of March 1, 2014 these still represent the best value.
I recommend shopping around at [NewEgg](http://www.newegg.com), [Amazon.com](http://www.amazon.com), [Frys](http://www.frys.com), [NCIX](http://www.ncix.com), and your local computer stores for the best price.
