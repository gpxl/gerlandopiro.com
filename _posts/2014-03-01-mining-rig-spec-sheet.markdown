If you are interested in building a mining rig but not sure where to start, things just got a lot easier.
Hereâ€™s my recommended spec sheet for a rig that, based on current market conditions, provides the best possible bang for the buck.
This build should cost about $1900, produce a hash rate of at least 2.5MH/s, and produce about $460/month.
It should draw about 1050 watts so it will work with any non shared 15 amp or greater circuit in your house.
If you are on a smaller budget you can start with only three GPUs and one PSU saving you $790 and leaving you with the option of expansion in the future.

  $1260 | GPU | 6 x [ASUS Raedon R9 270](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00GWV0ZD8/?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=ur2&tag=shnomo-20)  
  $135 | Motherboard | [Gigabyte GA-990FXA-UD3]()  
  $320 | PSU | 2x [Corsair AX 760W]()  
  $44 | CPU | [AMD Sempron 145 2.8GHZ]()  
  $45 | RAM | [G.Skill Ripjaws Series 2 x 2GB DDR3]()  
  $10 | HD | [SanDisk Cruzer 16GB USB Thumb Drive]()
