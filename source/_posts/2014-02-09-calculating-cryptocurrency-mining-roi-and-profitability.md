I have a simple way of calculating the time to ROI and profitability on my mining rigs. The formula is as follows.

1. [Look up the current value of a Bitcoin](http://bitcoinity.org/markets).

2. Visit a auto-switching mining pool, my current favorite is [Middlecoin](http://www.middlecoin.com), and get the current BTC/Mhs/day rate.

3. Calculate the cost to build a rig that achieves about 1 Mhs/day. A good starting point is 3 r9 270xs, 2 r9 280xs, or 2 r9 290s. A full list of cards and hash rates can be found [here](https://litecoin.info/Mining_hardware_comparison). Then, start pricing parts. [NewEgg](http://www.newegg.com) is a good place to start. You'll need a motherboard, cpu, ram, power supply, usb drive, and one or more video cards. 

4. Now simply calculate ($Bitcoin_Value*$Bitcoin_per_Mhs) to get your estimated daily payout and $Rig_cost/($Bitcoin_value*$Bitcoin_per_Mhs) to get your days till break even on your rig cost.

This is a simple estimation which does not take into account volatility in Bitcoin value or an increase in mining difficulty, but I believe adding a projection of either is adding speculation upon speculation. The crypto currency market is not for the faint of heart, but at least this should give you a baseline expectation with which to plan and track your progress.
