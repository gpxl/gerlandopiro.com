One of my goals for 2013 was to get better at writing by blogging more. I have many reasons for wanting this, but the biggest one is to overcome my introverted tendencies and see what resonates when I put my voice out into the world. However, by my own measure, I've been doing a horrible job so far with only nine posts published.

At first the issue was coming up with topics to write. I started this site with a challenge to create a web app that generated $5 in revenue and this skewed my thoughts as to what would be appropriate to post. Think about that, I mentally limited myself from day one based on expectations of a non-existant audience!

I recently attended [MisfitConf](http://aj-leon.com/misfit-conf), a conference of creative entrepreneurs that included an eclectic crowd of artists, life coaches, podcasters, writers, marketers, and so on. One of the messages I took away from the conference was to write about what you care about to find your voice. Since deciding that was the correct path for me, I've freed myself from self imposed limitations on topics and there has been no shortage of ideas for posts.

And yet I still struggle to write.

Another mental hangup I've discovered is the thought that a post has to meet a minimum word count to be of value. I'm not sure where this one came from, and I wasn't clearly aware of it until today! The mind works in mysterious ways for sure. But again with the realization that I was needlessly holding myself back, I'm leaving that limitation behind. Posts will be as long as they need to be and no more.

Another takeaway from MisfitConf via [Joshua Fields Millburn](http://www.twitter.com/jfm) was simply "sit in the chair" and get through the drudgery. What sounds simple is not so! At least for me :)

So this post is a stake in the ground; A renewed commitment to sit in the chair and get through the drudgery. To ensure one day I can look back at what I've done rather than think of what I should have done.
