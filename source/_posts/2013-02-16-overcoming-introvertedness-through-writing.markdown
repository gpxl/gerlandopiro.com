Ever since I was a kid I have found communication difficult. I avoid picking up phone calls from unknown numbers and I stumble over words when talking with friends as I am constantly searching for the right way to say something _while I'm in the middle of saying it!_ Now that I'm making an effort to document [my experience building a web app](/2013/01/27/starting-the-5-dollars-web-app-challenge), it's become clear that writing is a wonderful outlet for improving confidence in communicating and overcoming introvertedness.

In his book _[Influence: The Psychology of Persuasion](http://www.amazon.com/Influence-Psychology-Persuasion-Business-Essentials/dp/006124189X)_, author Dr. Cialdini outlines six weapons of influence that are commonly used to create desired outcomes in their targets. These "weapons" trigger desired reactions due to cultural and social norms that subtly control our decision making habits. One such weapon, commitment and consistency, is described with the observation, "Once we have made a choice or taken a stand, we will encounter personal and interpersonal pressures to behave consistently with that commitment." That is, once we have made a decision or taken action, we are predisposed to maintain that direction or ideal. Writing about an idea triggers creates and internal commitment and a need for consistency regardless of wether or not you believe what is written. 

The knowledge of this behavior was used to great effect in World War II to gather secret information from American POWs held in China. Rather than torture and threaten their prisoners, the Chinese army would persuade them to write a statement that sympathized with China's world view. This simple act of writing an idea down, an act of compliance, triggered a commitment to the idea. The need for consistency ensured that subsequent requests for compliance were accepted with greater and greater ease to the point where POWs freely shared military secrets with their enemy.

If commitment and consistency can have such a strong affect on American POWs, imagine what it could do if applied for self-betterment. It's no accident that the very first post to this blog was a declaration of intent, to create a revenue generating web application. The act of writing and committing to an idea is a strong trigger and sharing that idea publicly deepens the commitment. Once that is achieved, the consistency principle ensures the need for follow through.

Overcoming introvertedness is difficult, but writing can be a powerful tool for self motivation. So take a stand on something, write it down, and share it with others. You may be surprised at the results.
