I recently wiped my cell phone and installed the operating system from scratch rather than restore from backup. When it came time to set up email, I added my personal email address to the mail app but not my work email. Having been tethered to a work address for as long as I could remember, I was curious see what the consequences were. My mind's reaction was immediate.

Frequent message checking was a habit I had developed to counter worries of "Something might be broken" or "I'm missing an important message from my boss". With this tether broken I experienced an immediate swell of anxiety, fear, and uncertainty. Something was going to blow up or go wrong! It's crazy I know, but irrational thoughts rarely come true and nothing caught on fire from my lack of email. Instead, lot of positives have come to light.

I've realized that my personal email load is quite manageable, that is to say I'm not all that popular. I've been able to stay at "inbox zero" consistently which has a strange "spring cleaning" effect on the brain. Seriously, if you can't remember having an empty inbox go archive everything right now... I'll wait. 

Back yet? Ok! With personal email managed and lack of fires at work, there's no longer the urge to frequently check for new messages. Without the urge to check my phone, I've been able to focus on other aspects in life like spending quality time with my kids or improving my writing by creating more posts like these. My focus at work has improved as well since there is a better delineation of work and personal time. High fives all around!

It's easy to feel that you need to always maintain oversight on your work. It makes you feel productive and in control. But it could be a shackle preventing you from a more balanced life. Try removing work email from your phone and see what happens.
