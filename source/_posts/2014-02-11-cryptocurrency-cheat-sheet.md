Curious about Cryptocurrencies but not sure where to start? Here's a quick cheat sheet of resources to get you started.

### The Cryptocurrency Market

[Coinbase](https://www.coinbase.com/?r=5297831b5446868b09000036) is a Bitcoin exchange located in San Francisco. They are one of the most well funded Bitcoin companies in the world and provide a high [level of security](https://coinbase.com/security) around their services.

[Cryptsy](https://www.cryptsy.com/users/register?refid=105115) is a cryptocurrency exchange serving a huge number of coins. Cryptsy provides a crucial link in facilitating the conversion of alt-coins into Bitcoin.

[Coinwarz](http://www.coinwarz.com/cryptocurrency) lists the profitability of various cryptocurrencies. The calculations are done in real-time and are prone to wild swings so it's not the most reliable data, but it can serve as a good overview of the cryptocurrency market. 

[Bitcoinity](http://bitcoinity.org/markets) provides simple Bitcoin value charts for various exchanges. This site displays the current Bitcoin value in your browser tab so it remains useful even when not in focus.

[Bitinfocharts](http://bitinfocharts.com) shows detailed information on the largest cryptocurrency markets. It's amazing to see how much larger Bitcoin is relative to everything else. The parabolic difficulty curve is even more impressive ;)
 
### Cryptocurrency Mining

[GPU Mining Hardware Comparison](https://litecoin.info/Mining_hardware_comparison): This is a reference list of results with various GPU and CPU hardware along with the config settings. You'll want a card with a high hash rate (kH/s) to power (W) ratio. The card with the best ratio available, the AMD 7950, is discontinued and close to impossible to find at a good price. The r9 280x and r9 290 are good alternatives that are much easier to find. 

[Guide to Building Your Own Litecoin Mining Rig](http://www.cryptobadger.com/build-your-own-litecoin-mining-rig): This guide was the template from which I built my rig. The specific set of parts he lists is nearly impossible to find, but this will give you an idea of what to look for.

[Mining Software: CGMiner 3.7.2](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=28402.0): This is the reference thread for CGMiner, the software that will run your miner.

[MiddleCoin Mining Pool](http://middlecoin2.s3-website-us-west-2.amazonaws.com): This is my go to pool. Middlecoin is an auto-switching pool that seeks the most profitable alt coins to maximize the return on your hashing power. It also auto-exchanges mined coins and pays out in Bitcoin (BTC). Better still, joining the pool is as simple as pointing your miner at it using a Bitcoin wallet address.
